#### Search through your existing data

Search is a default habit in most organizations. We can tie asking with searching when there is no response or the user states he wasn't satisfied with the answer.

You arrive at a search box. It searches through documents. If you can't find it you can ask it directly from the search box. If there's an answer but it's across several documents you can highlight it and it will become the answer. The query will remain as a type of reminder of what you've searched and maybe someone who will search something similar will tell you the answer. BY seeing relevant searches from the knowledgebase or just relevant searches you will be able to find your answer quickly.

#### Record your workflow

Let's say someone asks you a question similar to "What is our churn rate for December?". Instead of asking you the second time you could record your workflow via a screencast and this way the user would know next time how to do it.

#### Recognize whether the bug is a duplicate by looking at images

#### You are a busy executive, don't repeat yourself for every on-bording process

#### You are a caring developer, don't frustrate yourself over every already answered question

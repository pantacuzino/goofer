#### Customer Hypothesis

people with on-boarding responsibilities

#### Problem Hypothesis

How to Build an Onboarding Plan for a New Hire. Managers are often so driven to recruit talented workers that they neglect to think about what will happen once the new hire arrives ready to work

#### Design Experiments (Assumptions):

- on-boarding represents a challenge
- on-boarding is done via a process
- people recognize what a good on-boarding looks like
- people see answering a question without writing down the answer as bad
- people don't want to be disturbed during their holidays
- people mind when they are being asked the same question multiple times
- people mind when they are being asked a question which already was answered somewhere
- people understand the importance of onboarding (the ultimate payoff is to reduce turnover and encourage workers to stay with an organization for a longer tenure.)
- time to people to become productive in an environment is too long
- collaborative on-boarding by pinning and ordering various pieces of questions.
- people get asked a lot of questions every day and this bothers them (disrupts their tranquility)

NB:

- It's an iterative process, the problem Hypothesis will change. It might not yield any business ideas but it will help you learn.
- Am I trying to solve an economic problem which manifests itself as an overgeneralization problem?
- The hardest thing seems to be finding people to talk to as I don't have a specific network built. I can look over stats of stackoverflow to see the distribution of people in specific countries and try to work from there.
- The people at crowdbase sell or quandora sell to a specific audience. What is there audience?
- That said, everything in a B2B play takes time, so itâ€™s good to get used to it now before you bet the farm.
- One of my assumption was that cold emailing doesn't work ... but people seem to dig it.
- I can go around to people who are doing Seedcamp as our product was in this incubator
- Another simple way is to just forward to a mail address which indexes the mail and this way everyone has access to it.

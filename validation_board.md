#### Customer Hypothesis

people in senior roles with on-boarding responsibilities

#### Problem Hypothesis

No idea what a good on-boarding should look like

#### Design Experiments:

- on-boarding represents a challenge
- on-boarding is done via a process
- people recognize what a good on-boarding looks like
- people see answering a question without writing down the answer as bad
- people don't want to be disturbed during their holidays
- people mind when they are being asked the same question multiple times
- people mind when they are being asked a question which already was answered somewhere

NB:

- It's an iterative process, the problem Hypothesis will change. It might not yield any business ideas but it will help you learn.

#### Workato Chat Bot Brings Enterprise Workflow Into Slack

As we head into 2016, enterprise chat applications like Slack are suddenly a hot commodity, and if you’re inside chat a good portion of the day the argument goes, you should be able to access other work without leaving the chat client. This is exactly what Workato’s newly announced chat bot, Workbot, is designed to do.

> Yes, alt+tab-ing is not an option anymore because you loose focus #laughing

Chat bots are small programs that integrate with a chat platform and provide some advanced type of functionality in a fairly easy fashion. The new Workbot-chat bot enables users to access and control over 100 enterprise applications such as a Salesforce CRM record, Quickbooks accounting information or Zendesk customer service interactions directly inside of Slack.

> Great, at least it can disseminate information which was not previously available to people without CRM access

One of the primary issues with early Enterprise 2.0 tools was that they were just another application busy employees needed to pay attention to. The idea here is to give users customer information directly in the context of the discussion they may be having with a fellow employee in an integrated fashion (or to simply get the information from the bot without prompting).

> Information will become stale in the chat records and it's not like Salesforce is chat ... What type of business are these guys trying to build?

“One of the things we saw in early collaboration tools like Yammer or Salesforce Chatter was that after initial hype that we have a new tool and we don’t have to do email, people eventually got resentful that these tools became one more feed you needed to pay attention to and take care of,” Anshu Sharma, venture partner at Storm Ventures, one of Workato’s investor’s explained.

> They don't need to pay attention to anything, attention is rather expensive, they need to figure out if the information is relevant when they need it.

The idea behind Workato’s Workbot is to let employees interact directly with enterprise applications that matter to them inside the chat client — and bring a level of automation to that. It’s worth noting that it requires a certain language to get that information (much like you have to ask the Amazon Echo a question just the right way), but it’s also possible to create connections to enterprise apps with simple aliases like ‘customer info’ to reduce the amount of typing.

> The business is asking questions and receiving answers from various platforms inside your Slack. Information is spread across various stores and you need your answer in context. When a screenshot doesn't help you can do this.

The tool has three main tasks. First of all, it can provide users with a full view of the customer inside of Slack, pulling the information from various customer information sources, but it’s not just a pure integration tool. It also provides a level of intelligence to the data by filtering more important information such as ticket priority, customer location or past due invoices. Finally, customers can define triggers so that if a certain threshold is met such as x number of outstanding support tickets, the customer service manager would get a message from Workbot inside of Slack automatically.

> It's not clear why are they doing this. And this type of article might be just another sponsored one. Don't you have these types of alerts in ticketing systems? Why are you trying to grab their attention and deciding what they should be working on?

Workato is a company concentrating on simplifying enterprise integration. Instead of using expensive or complex enterprise workflow or integration tools, Workato’s goal has been to simplify the process so that non-technical end users could create integrations on their own, putting together “recipes” that created workflows, like IFFT has done on the consumer level.

> Did a PR agency write this? It's IFFT for the enterpise #think #laughing

This isn’t the first time companies have tried to integrate enterprise applications inside a messaging tool. We have seen it extensively in email  with many companies trying to integrate inside of Microsoft Outlook.

What’s more, in the early part of this century there was a short-lived attempt to make enterprise instant messaging clients  the center of our work lives, a vision that didn’t quite come to fruition.

It’s also worth noting that Facebook is trying something similar for consumers inside Messenger.

Workato also announced a private beta of Workbot for HipChat.

#### TMW DEPLOYS BLOOMFIRE FOR INTRANET AND SOCIAL LEARNING

TMW Systems is a transportation management systems and trucking software provider who is making their transportation customers more efficient and profitable. TMW helps make the most of available capacity, bringing workflow automation and powerful business intelligence to the complex world of logistics operations and fleet management. Based in Cleveland, TMW employs 700 people, with satellite offices across the U.S. and Canada.

A Need to Socialize Knowledge

In 2014, TMW was changing rapidly; there were a lot of new employees coming on board. With a large percentage of employees primarily using email to share information, the company was finding that a lot of institutional knowledge was getting lost. By the end of the year, they decided it was the right time for a better social learning solution.

John Kittinger is the Internal Training Team Lead at TMW Systems, responsible for onboarding new employees and facilitating internal knowledge sharing.

“We needed a way to capture what our experienced employees know and distribute it to everyone else,” Kittinger said. “We also wanted to streamline information sharing in our support process to record best practices for future reference – rather than tracking down answers to the same questions over and over again.”

The Search for the Right Social Learning Solution

The company already had SharePoint and NetSuite, and they considered using each to solve their knowledge management problem. They also looked at open source wikis, CrowdBase, Jive, Confluence, SmartSupport, Evernote and Google Docs. In the end, their decision came down to two solutions: SharePoint and Bloomfire.

“If we had chosen SharePoint, we would have had to hire a developer to build something from the ground up,” Kittinger said. “We needed something our employees could pick up and use right away.”

“Bloomfire is tailor-made for both knowledge management and social learning; it’s also easy to use. Bloomfire was a perfect fit,” said Kittinger.

A Thoughtful and Measured Rollout of Bloomfire

TMW began using Bloomfire in September 2014. They uploaded materials and presentations from their annual user conference to seed the community with content. The company is organized into industry verticals and Kittinger seeded the community by going vertical by vertical to identify important documents to include in Bloomfire. He then did targeted training with the management and employees of each division to show them how to use Bloomfire to capture knowledge and encourage social learning. TMW focused on rolling out Bloomfire to customer-facing employees in sales and support. By early January, they had 300 users on Bloomfire.

TMW primarily uses Bloomfire to share information about their products, including tips and tricks, releases, and new features. They lean heavily on the question and answer engine as a replacement for email so that this knowledge is captured and accessible to anyone.

“People like the ease of use and the ability to share multi-media content. The search engine has been a big win since, in the past, we had documents that were forever lost in random places on shared network drives,” Kittinger said.

Bloomfire is also now part of the onboarding process. New employees attend a formal two-week training class where they learn about TMW’s products. In the past, everyone received a full three-inch binder with product information. That information has now moved into Bloomfire.

“We’re working to create a seamless transition between our formal training and on-the-job training,” said Kittinger. “We’ve integrated Bloomfire into our live training classes and we encourage new employees to take advantage of it for their informal social learning as well.”

A Cultural Shift to Become More Open and Collaborative

Kittinger says that Bloomfire is part of a significant cultural change at TMW, as the organization moves to become more open and collaborative.

“It’s opened up new ways of thinking about how we share information,” he said. “We’re giving our employees the confidence to know that there is one place to look. If an answer exists, it should be in Bloomfire. If they find it somewhere else, they know it’s their responsibility as a member of the community to share what they’ve learned in Bloomfire so that it’s there for the next person,” Kittinger said.

TMW’s end-goal is to build a self-sustaining community, so engagement is the most important metric they are tracking. During the first two months of 2015, 78 percent of users viewed content, and 32 percent had contributed, hi-fived, or commented. In addition, 87 percent of questions in the community have been answered.

“We want to incent users to add useful content to the community,” Kittinger said. “And we’re continuing to integrate Bloomfire into our employees’ flow of work so that it becomes an indispensable resource that everyone is responsible for sustaining.”

#### ETSY USES BLOOMFIRE TO SAVE OVER TEN THOUSAND HOURS ANNUALLY

Etsy is an e-commerce marketplace for handmade goods, vintage items, and supplies for making any craft imaginable. The community at Etsy.com is made up of independent creative businesses from around the globe looking to sell their crafty creations. This Brooklyn-based company has grown its community to more than 22 million members across 200 countries.

The Challenge

Etsy had struggled to find the right tool to help its ninety support agents on the Member Operations team share documents, ideas, and update content. Their engineers make regular changes and updates to Etsy.com, and leadership needed a way to quickly share the most up-to-date information and product screenshots with support agents.

“One of the main issues we encountered with our company wide ‘wiki’ was not being able to find the information we need to do our job,” said Jennifer Nishinaga, Etsy’s Training and Development Manager. “The portal was being used by everyone in the company so there was an abundance of duplicate and outdated content. It was extremely difficult to locate the information that our support agents needed in order to answer our members’ questions.”

> It was extremely difficult is equivalent to we don't have a way to search, thus let's put it in a different system which we know.

The team began looking for a collaboration tool that would house all of their reference content and give them the ability to interact socially. They needed a tool where they could not only upload content, but was also easily searchable and where the document could be quickly edited as needed.

“It was very important that we didn’t get into versioning wars,” said Nishinaga. “We need to be able to edit on-the-fly and access the latest version of the document.”

> Wouldn't that particular editing be useful in the context of the original document as well?

Why Bloomfire

Etsy looked at a variety of different tools, and ultimately chose Bloomfire to solve their knowledge problem. It’s being used as a training and documentation portal that is maintained by senior members of the Member Operations team.

“We felt it fit our goal of creating a centralized portal for member operations and the UI is intuitive. We also liked the added features of notifications, following authors/members, and *seeing who has viewed a post/series*” said Nishinaga.

*They liked that Bloomfire makes it easy to post and search for product screenshots.*

“For example, our mobile application looks different on various types of phones. Bloomfire is useful because our engineers and product management team can post the latest screenshots everytime we launch a new version. That way, our support team can confidently troubleshoot knowing that the screen they are viewing is identical to what the caller is looking at,” Nishinaga said.

Results

*Etsy is using Bloomfire as a training and documentation portal for our Member Operations team. They like that agents can subscribe to notifications and access new and updated posts relevant to their area of specialization. They appreciate the ability to see who has looked at a post so that the training team can hold agents accountable.*

“Agents are adding comments and questions every day, as well as spending time in the portal during their down time,” said Nishinaga. “*They check Bloomfire first for answers when a question or issue arises.* We’re continually adding and updating content so that our agents can quickly and efficiently serve our members needs.”

“With a fast-growing company like Etsy, we’re finding it more difficult to locate relevant and updated documentation internally. We are also expanding internationally and need to provide those abroad with current information even if we’re not in the same time zone to answer questions live. Bloomfire is our constantly evolving online manual for all of our support operations.”

“Our support agents are saving two to three hours a week thanks to Bloomfire,” she said.

Nishinaga estimates that Etsy is saving a total of over ten thousand hours of wasted time each year by using Bloomfire.

#### How to Build an Onboarding Plan for a New Hire

With the economy on the upswing, many growing companies are starting to go after talented new employees. *That means a lot of first days on the jobs, and lot of time and money to spend while new staffers get up to speed. What if you could shrink the time it takes for an employee to reach his or her full potential?*

That's the promise of a growing trend in human-resources management called onboarding; its advocates describe it as a comprehensive approach to bringing on new hires that goes beyond simple orientation. Onboarding plans are intended to make new employees familiar with the overall goals of a company and support them as they embark on early projects all in an effort to achieve the perception of success (and productivity) quickly. The ultimate payoff is to reduce turnover and encourage workers to stay with an organization for a longer tenure.

> onboarding is seen as a HR initiative which involves planning, going beyond orientation (which is an event).

'It's really about calculating the cost of hiring new workers to the business,' says John Sullivan, former chief talent officer for Agilent Technologies and a professor of management at San Francisco State University. 'Companies need new hires to be productive and, at a small company especially, every employee counts.'

Here's a look at how your company can set up an onboarding process *to shorten the learning curve for new hires.*

Onboarding a New Hire: Plan Ahead

Think onboarding begins on an employee's first day? Wrong. A successful onboarding program actually begins during the recruitment and hiring process, says Erin Perry, director of client solutions at Pinstripe, a recruiting company based in Brookfield, Wisconsin. An onboarding process is linked to and in some ways starts with the employer brand that you create to attract people who are the right fit for your company's overall goals. 'If you're a high tech organization that has a cool brand and that uses social media and talks about innovation when you're advertising to attract new associates, that's great," Perry says. "But if on a new hire's first day you hand them 15 different forms to fill out, your employment brand message has just died."

Experts suggest you begin the orientation process before a candidate is formally hired by including ample information about your workplace and your culture in the Careers section on your website. 'The orientation should begin at the first click of the mouse when someone first goes on the company's website, so by the time the person comes in for the interview, they already know quite a lot about the organization,' says Richard Jordan, a business coach who has been responsible for reshaping the recruiting and orientation process at a number of technology firms. That way, you are more likely to attract candidates who are more engaged with your company's goals and culture and are more likely to become highly productive employees.

A new hire will surely be required to fill out a lot of new paperwork, so why not get a head start? Many companies choose to send necessary legal forms along with a formal offer letter. You can also send an employee handbook ahead of time, so that new staff members aren't overwhelmed with information on the first day.

> employee handbook. I am trying to recognize industry terms I assume US people are accustomed to.

HR software and other related applications can also be deployed ahead of time. *Automated systems are especially useful because onboarding requires the involvement of multiple departments within a company, all working together to welcome and engage a new employee, to make him or her feel as comfortable as possible from Day One.* The right technology can help coordinate various individuals and tasks by taking care of paperwork electronically, or sending notifications alerting IT support staff to configure a new hire's laptop and BlackBerry.

> onboarding is seen as configuring a laptop and a blackberry? It might be, but it goes beyond this. And being comfortable on the first day doesn't correlate with anything. It's outside of the company's control whether the employee feels comfortable or not. You are thinking about physical stuff instead of the actual experience. onboarding is an experience

Technology can also be an effective way to socialize your new hire into your company's organizational culture, Perry says. *On a company Intranet, you can make available to a new hire multimedia such as video and podcasts that state your company's overall strategic goals, talk about your company's values, and provide employee testimonials. As a bonus, these videos can feature company leaders, which will help introduce key players, cutting down on the endless name game that typically happens on an employee's first day.*

> It depends on the type of company you are trying to build. But the type of information they say they should present "strategic goals, company values, employee testimonials" is valuable.

Onboarding a New Hire: On the First Day, Nail the Details

*The prospect of the first day on the job is nerve-wracking. New hires are eager to impress their new bosses. So, if they don't know where the photocopier is or how to use it, chances are they aren't going to ask, and will waste time trying to figure the little things out for themselves. And if you throw a bunch of information at them, chances are they're not going to remember most of it. With an effective onboarding program, you should aim to present basic information in an easy-to-digest fashion, so that a rookie can turn to the more demanding aspects of his or her job.*

> Now we are getting somewhere. Are your employees first day nerve-wracking? It's a hard thing to recognize because it's outside of your control.

The way to do that is to consider the small, logistical details that add up to a sense of comfort and familiarity one has in a workplace. This is good not just for a new hire's peace of mind, but also for the overall health and well-being of your business. 'If a person is new and doesn't know how to use the phone system and accidentally hangs up on a potential client, that client is not going to care that they were new,' says John Sullivan. 'They're just going to be angry.'

Here's a list of things you should have ready by the time your new hires walk in the door:

Send out an e-mail to everyone in the office so they're prepared to welcome a new employee.
Get the new worker a security badge if he or she needs one.
Provide a name plate on his or her desk or office door as a tangible sign that you've prepared the space.
Set up the computer.
Configure the new employee's e-mail accounts.
Provide guides for any necessary software he or she will be using.
Set up his or her phone system, and provide instructions for using voicemail.
Have a stack of business cards waiting.
And here's a list of questions you should answer for the new employee voluntarily:

What should he or she bring? (Telling them to bring two forms of ID to verify paperwork is a good idea.)
Where should he or she park?
Who should he or she ask for in the lobby?
Where are the restrooms?
Where is the copy machine? (And how does it work?)
Where is the cafeteria?
Who should the employee talk to if he or she has additional questions? (It's a good idea to assign a co-worker or a hiring manager as a mentor to check-in with the new hire throughout at least the first week.)
A new employee's immediate supervisor should also be present on the first day. 'The worst thing you can do is have new hires show up when their immediate supervisor isn't there for three or four days,' Sullivan says. 'It's like getting married and not having your spouse on your honeymoon.'

> I don't think it matters that much to show people where the bathroom is. Why don't you use signs on the wall? Onboarding has to be about more than showing where the cafeteria is. Maybe I am looking at the wrong side of the story

Dig Deeper: Mastering a New Employee's First Day

Onboarding a New Hire:  Individualizing the Process

Unlike a traditional first-day orientation, where an employee generally spends a good chunk of time signing forms for Human Resources and reviewing the policies of the organization, onboarding is intended to be a multi-faceted approach. And while the list of things to consider for a new hire's first day applies to pretty much any employee, that doesn't mean you should forget about the unique needs of each individual. Quite the opposite, in fact.

For example, different people prefer different management styles, so why not ask a new employee from the start how he or she wants to be managed? 'Onboarding is a performance-based, customized approach,' Sullivan says. 'Why don't ask you upfront what is the best way to manage you?'

A more personal element to the process can engage new employees, giving them the ability to identify their personal goals with the overall success of the organization. Ari Weinzweig, CEO of the Zingerman's Community of Businesses, a group of food specialty businesses in Ann Arbor, Michigan, still personally teaches an orientation class to new staffers. 'By taking the time to teach the orientation, the clear message that comes across is that we value them and their work so highly that the head of the company is willing to sit with them to go over things,' he says.

Make sure a new staff member understands how he or she can individually contribute to the company. Explain to the employee how your performance appraisal system works, so he or she won't waste time on things that don't matter, and can quickly begin to work on key objectives. If you make a custom onboarding plan, 'you're leaving the individual with the impression that employees are very important assets to the organization, chosen from among many candidates, and that their talent and potential is recognized,' Jordan says. 'You want to make sure you develop their career path within the organization.'

How vested an employee feels to a company also has to do with the social relationships he or she makes with co-workers. An onboarding process should consider those relationships and facilitate them from the very beginning. Organize a lunch on the first day with the new employee's team or department the new employee. Or try giving your new employee a week's worth of gift certificates for lunch, so he or she can take a colleague to lunch each day.

Onboarding a New Hire: Following Through on Your Plan

On-boarding doesn't end on the Friday of a new employee's first week on the job. The process should continue over the span of several months and, during that time, it is essential to solicit feedback from all constituents. A good way to do that is to assign a recruiting manager to keep track of the new hire's first few months on the job, Jordan says, because that individual will already have developed a relationship with the employee.

'I'm a big believer of surveying at every step of the process,' Perry says. She suggests surveying at the end of the first week and at the close of each of the employee's first three months, asking different questions at each stage. Begin with questions about the recruiting process, how the first day met the employee's expectations, and whether they are struggling with any issues related to technology. Then, start asking whether the employee has the necessary tools to complete his or her job and, finally, begin asking about an employee's strategic goals. You want to learn how engaged or connected the new hire feels to the organization.

You also want to make sure someone is accountable, preferably a line manager who realizes the cost savings to the business if a new employee gets up to speed quicker. You want managers to be very aware that you are measuring productivity through metrics. Make sure employees actually are becoming productive and, if they are not, figure out what is going wrong. Continually fine-tune how you onboard employees to make sure you can maximize the benefits of the process.

Once you've done that, you can begin to establish a general checklist of what you want to cover when you're onboarding. Even within that structured plan or process, make sure you leave room for those personal touches. 'Your employees are going to get orientated whether you plan for it or not," Perry observes. "But if you do plan it, it's a lot more likely to be successful."

#### Experiment Board Tutorial with Grace Ng

Three methods to test assumptions: interview (get in front of customers and get answers), pre-sale (when you sell something before actually having it) and concierge (where you manually deliver the service for your customer)

http://kevindewalt.com/2013/01/21/bad-customer-development-questions-and-how-to-avoid-my-mistakes/

#### Bad Customer Development Questions and How to Avoid My Mistakes

Summary: Although Customer Development can give us tremendous insight into market problems, it takes a lot of time – time that’s wasted if we do it incorrectly. Worse yet, poorly worded questions can cause us to reach wrong conclusions about what people want. The best questions don’t require customers to speculate about their behavior. Here I share real examples my bad questions and mistakes and offer some better alternatives.

If you’re starting Customer Development you’re getting ready to talk to a lot of potential customers. You started with an an idea, wrote down your key assumptions, and started flipping through contacts to see who you can interview.

Awesome! You’re off to a great start. Talking face-to-face with customers brings us insight we can’t get from surveys and clicks.

Unfortunately, conducting face-to-face customer development interviews is a skill that takes practice. I’ve been doing it for 5 years and I’m still learning. So many times I’ve asked the wrong questions and later realized I was wasting time or – worse yet – coming to incorrect conclusions and building the wrong products.

“Learn Nothing” Questions

I call “Learn Nothing” questions those that don’t result in any learning, just wasted time.

“What do you think of my idea?”

I LOVE talking about startup ideas. To quote my friend Patrick Smith, “talking about startups is entertainment like sports”. Fun, yes. Validated learning? No.  What do you think of my startup idea? is useless because if my idea is great people will like it. If it sucks, surely some people will still like it.

“If you could wave a magic wand…”

I know Steve Blank calls this the “IPO question”. I call it the “sit back and watch people ramble about things I have no chance of building” question. I’ve asked this question at the end of meetings and – after some funny looks – watched somebody ramble. It just hasn’t worked for me.

“Can you tell me about your problems with medical bills?”

I asked this question a few times before realizing that asking people to talk about problems just results in venting and no learning. This is particularly true with complex, personal, emotionally charged problems like those in health care.  “Well there was this one time….and then…but what really got me mad…”

“False Positive” Questions

Wrong conclusions are worse than no learning at all, and I call “False Positive” questions those designed to get customers to tell us what we want to hear.

All of us want our product ideas to be right – I want it, you want it, Steve Jobs wanted it. While our enthusiasm is our biggest asset, it is dangerous in customer development because most people don’t want to disappoint us.

> +1 most people don't want to dissapoint us. Could I create questions which are designed to make people dissapoint us?

“I’m building a product to help people manage medical bills. Can you tell me…”

Any question that starts with the solution already biases people’s expectations. Someone hearing this question might focus on a minor problem they had with medical billing in the past and convince us that it is a major source of pain.

> Leading question, I will have to revise the structure of questions, but maybe a book on interogatory techniques might help. They do work at making people say what they want.

Better: Skip the “I’m building a…” intro.

“How do you reconcile your HSA account with your bills, receipts, and statements to make sure you’re optimizing future tax savings?”

The “How do you do something complex to achieve results” questions can put people on the defensive. You can imagine someone thinking, “You mean I’m supposed to be doing something with that paperwork to save money on taxes? Oh no, I’m such an idiot, what am I doing wrong?”

Of course customers will be biased to tell us they need help with something after we cause them to doubt their own competence.

> +1 it makes sense, guilty as charged. I thought this was the whole point to sell them something, make them realize they have a problem.

Better: “What do you do with that HSA paperwork?”

“Would you take a picture of a medical bill with your iPhone?”

This question sets up the prospective customer to tell us what we obviously want to hear.

Better questions would give us insight into how they currently work and whether the extra steps and inconvenience of using our products gives a promise of a big return.

Better: “Do you scan or file medical bills you get in the mail?”

> I can understand the difference, let me see how I can integrate this. Would you take a picture versus Do you scan. One is for a future behaviour and one is asking for current behaviour which is what we want to know about.

This question is better because it gives someone the opportunity to disappoint us without realizing it, what Rob Fitzpatrick calls the “mom test”.

In this case, suppose your key assumption is that managing bills via in iPhone app saves time over filing or scanning. Should they respond, “Scan them? I’m too busy for that, I don’t even open them,” you’ve just invalidated your whole company vision with one question.

The Key to Effective Customer Development

In retrospect, the root of my bad questions was that I only had an idea – I didn’t have specific hypothesis I was trying to validate. I tried to replace the hard work of documenting and testing assumptions with meetings and simply wasted time.

Always remember that Customer Development is a big commitment that takes a huge amount of time, time best spent on something else if you’re not doing it right.

Before you line up a bunch of meetings and spend weeks talking to people, take some time to carefully consider what you’re going to ask and why.  The key is to make sure your questions are designed to test your assumptions.  I write them down and you should too.  

Talk with your co-founders or advisers about your interview script. If you need help, I’m happy to review it with you.

#### Check yo’ Segment

When I’ve interviewed customers in the past and couldn’t quickly get a clear picture on their answers (i.e. interviewed more than 5 people and “everyone had different problems”) it was because I was interviewing people across customer segments.

I was interviewing *“small and medium sized businesses”* when I should have been interviewing, **“US law firms specializing in IP law with 5 – 25 lawyers, and who are LexisNexis customers.”**

I was interviewing *“friends and family members of people with ADHD”* when I should have been interviewing **“working age people with smart phones who live within 50 miles of US urban centers and within an hour of a sibling diagnosed with ADHD.”**

#### How to Interview your Customers

Interviewing Customers is a Special Kind of Torture

Talk to a stranger. Fun.
That stranger is immensely busy…and hates being sold things. Getting better.
That stranger will likely destroy your vision for a company. Ready to get started?!

When I started interviewing customers, the only thing I cared less about than talking about other people’s problems, was asking about them. So, I skipped all the questions I thought were BS, and jumped to the most important ones:

“Would you use a product that does _____________?” and “How much would you pay for it?”
Turns out, those aren’t the most important questions…they’re the most misleading. Apparently, I am not a natural interviewer.

When I realized interviewing customers meant standing in front of strangers doing something I was awful at, any enthusiasm I had towards “getting out of the building”, evaporated.

When I see other founders hesitate to interview customers, or do them wrong, I empathize. I’ve been there. It’s a daunting task we have no experience with – and – isn’t nearly as fun as building stuff.

Let’s Fix That

Despite my early misgivings, learning to interview customers has become one of my most indispensable skills. Not just because it gives me a leg up on competitors, not because it helps me (in)validate ideas quickly, and not because it helps in my personal life as much as it does my professional. It’s indispensable because…

For me, interviewing customers makes customer development…fulfilling.
Instead of being stressed about what the customer is going to think about my idea, instead of fumbling over my words and worrying about the perfect way to pitch my product, a customer interview isn’t about me, my product, or my words. It’s about theirs. All I have to do is listen. No pitching, no negotiating, just ask a handful of questions with a sincere interest to learn.

How Not to Interview

A few ground rules I use that will prevent you from torpedoing your interviews:

1st rule of validating your idea: Do not talk about your idea. Tweet this
tyler-fight-club-quote1 Your brain is hard wired to screw you as soon as you start thinking about your idea.

Once your idea pops into your brain during an interview, your body will literally turn against you. It will start looking for validation that the idea is good. Your interpretations of statements, intonation, body language will all be skewed. What’s worse, the person you’re talking to subconsciously knows what you’re looking for, and based on our desire to build relationships, will want to help you. They’ll be your unwitting accomplice and provide the  “validation” you’re looking for – leading you in the wrong direction. To the best of your abilities, avoid thinking about your idea during the interview – and certainly avoid talking about it. These interviews are about your customers and their problems. Do your best to keep the conversation focused there.

2nd rule of validating your idea: Do not ask about the future.
No hypotheticals, no projections, no guesses. The way I remember this rule? I never ask a question with the word “would” in it:

“If we built a product that solved X problem, would you use it?”
“How much would you pay for something that did X?”
“Would you like your existing solution better if it did X?”
When you use the word “would”, you’re making a thinly veiled attempt to validate your product…not their problem. Don’t do that. See Rule #1.



In addition, when you ask about the future, you’re asking your customer to predict it. She can’t do that. She’ll try, but she’ll be wrong. Listening to wrong answers can only serve to harm you (“75% of people I talked to said they wanted…”, “Half of the interviewees said they’d pay $20″, etc.) – they’re all bad guesses. There are better ways to answer those questions.

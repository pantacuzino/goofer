#### Workato Chat Bot Brings Enterprise Workflow Into Slack

As we head into 2016, enterprise chat applications like Slack are suddenly a hot commodity, and if you’re inside chat a good portion of the day the argument goes, you should be able to access other work without leaving the chat client. This is exactly what Workato’s newly announced chat bot, Workbot, is designed to do.

> Yes, alt+tab-ing is not an option anymore because you loose focus #laughing

Chat bots are small programs that integrate with a chat platform and provide some advanced type of functionality in a fairly easy fashion. The new Workbot-chat bot enables users to access and control over 100 enterprise applications such as a Salesforce CRM record, Quickbooks accounting information or Zendesk customer service interactions directly inside of Slack.

> Great, at least it can disseminate information which was not previously available to people without CRM access

One of the primary issues with early Enterprise 2.0 tools was that they were just another application busy employees needed to pay attention to. The idea here is to give users customer information directly in the context of the discussion they may be having with a fellow employee in an integrated fashion (or to simply get the information from the bot without prompting).

> Information will become stale in the chat records and it's not like Salesforce is chat ... What type of business are these guys trying to build?

“One of the things we saw in early collaboration tools like Yammer or Salesforce Chatter was that after initial hype that we have a new tool and we don’t have to do email, people eventually got resentful that these tools became one more feed you needed to pay attention to and take care of,” Anshu Sharma, venture partner at Storm Ventures, one of Workato’s investor’s explained.

> They don't need to pay attention to anything, attention is rather expensive, they need to figure out if the information is relevant when they need it.

The idea behind Workato’s Workbot is to let employees interact directly with enterprise applications that matter to them inside the chat client — and bring a level of automation to that. It’s worth noting that it requires a certain language to get that information (much like you have to ask the Amazon Echo a question just the right way), but it’s also possible to create connections to enterprise apps with simple aliases like ‘customer info’ to reduce the amount of typing.

> The business is asking questions and receiving answers from various platforms inside your Slack. Information is spread across various stores and you need your answer in context. When a screenshot doesn't help you can do this.

The tool has three main tasks. First of all, it can provide users with a full view of the customer inside of Slack, pulling the information from various customer information sources, but it’s not just a pure integration tool. It also provides a level of intelligence to the data by filtering more important information such as ticket priority, customer location or past due invoices. Finally, customers can define triggers so that if a certain threshold is met such as x number of outstanding support tickets, the customer service manager would get a message from Workbot inside of Slack automatically.

> It's not clear why are they doing this. And this type of article might be just another sponsored one. Don't you have these types of alerts in ticketing systems? Why are you trying to grab their attention and deciding what they should be working on?

Workato is a company concentrating on simplifying enterprise integration. Instead of using expensive or complex enterprise workflow or integration tools, Workato’s goal has been to simplify the process so that non-technical end users could create integrations on their own, putting together “recipes” that created workflows, like IFFT has done on the consumer level.

> Did a PR agency write this? It's IFFT for the enterpise #think #laughing

This isn’t the first time companies have tried to integrate enterprise applications inside a messaging tool. We have seen it extensively in email  with many companies trying to integrate inside of Microsoft Outlook.

What’s more, in the early part of this century there was a short-lived attempt to make enterprise instant messaging clients  the center of our work lives, a vision that didn’t quite come to fruition.

It’s also worth noting that Facebook is trying something similar for consumers inside Messenger.

Workato also announced a private beta of Workbot for HipChat.

#### TMW DEPLOYS BLOOMFIRE FOR INTRANET AND SOCIAL LEARNING

TMW Systems is a transportation management systems and trucking software provider who is making their transportation customers more efficient and profitable. TMW helps make the most of available capacity, bringing workflow automation and powerful business intelligence to the complex world of logistics operations and fleet management. Based in Cleveland, TMW employs 700 people, with satellite offices across the U.S. and Canada.

A Need to Socialize Knowledge

In 2014, TMW was changing rapidly; there were a lot of new employees coming on board. With a large percentage of employees primarily using email to share information, the company was finding that a lot of institutional knowledge was getting lost. By the end of the year, they decided it was the right time for a better social learning solution.

John Kittinger is the Internal Training Team Lead at TMW Systems, responsible for onboarding new employees and facilitating internal knowledge sharing.

“We needed a way to capture what our experienced employees know and distribute it to everyone else,” Kittinger said. “We also wanted to streamline information sharing in our support process to record best practices for future reference – rather than tracking down answers to the same questions over and over again.”

The Search for the Right Social Learning Solution

The company already had SharePoint and NetSuite, and they considered using each to solve their knowledge management problem. They also looked at open source wikis, CrowdBase, Jive, Confluence, SmartSupport, Evernote and Google Docs. In the end, their decision came down to two solutions: SharePoint and Bloomfire.

“If we had chosen SharePoint, we would have had to hire a developer to build something from the ground up,” Kittinger said. “We needed something our employees could pick up and use right away.”

“Bloomfire is tailor-made for both knowledge management and social learning; it’s also easy to use. Bloomfire was a perfect fit,” said Kittinger.

A Thoughtful and Measured Rollout of Bloomfire

TMW began using Bloomfire in September 2014. They uploaded materials and presentations from their annual user conference to seed the community with content. The company is organized into industry verticals and Kittinger seeded the community by going vertical by vertical to identify important documents to include in Bloomfire. He then did targeted training with the management and employees of each division to show them how to use Bloomfire to capture knowledge and encourage social learning. TMW focused on rolling out Bloomfire to customer-facing employees in sales and support. By early January, they had 300 users on Bloomfire.

TMW primarily uses Bloomfire to share information about their products, including tips and tricks, releases, and new features. They lean heavily on the question and answer engine as a replacement for email so that this knowledge is captured and accessible to anyone.

“People like the ease of use and the ability to share multi-media content. The search engine has been a big win since, in the past, we had documents that were forever lost in random places on shared network drives,” Kittinger said.

Bloomfire is also now part of the onboarding process. New employees attend a formal two-week training class where they learn about TMW’s products. In the past, everyone received a full three-inch binder with product information. That information has now moved into Bloomfire.

“We’re working to create a seamless transition between our formal training and on-the-job training,” said Kittinger. “We’ve integrated Bloomfire into our live training classes and we encourage new employees to take advantage of it for their informal social learning as well.”

A Cultural Shift to Become More Open and Collaborative

Kittinger says that Bloomfire is part of a significant cultural change at TMW, as the organization moves to become more open and collaborative.

“It’s opened up new ways of thinking about how we share information,” he said. “We’re giving our employees the confidence to know that there is one place to look. If an answer exists, it should be in Bloomfire. If they find it somewhere else, they know it’s their responsibility as a member of the community to share what they’ve learned in Bloomfire so that it’s there for the next person,” Kittinger said.

TMW’s end-goal is to build a self-sustaining community, so engagement is the most important metric they are tracking. During the first two months of 2015, 78 percent of users viewed content, and 32 percent had contributed, hi-fived, or commented. In addition, 87 percent of questions in the community have been answered.

“We want to incent users to add useful content to the community,” Kittinger said. “And we’re continuing to integrate Bloomfire into our employees’ flow of work so that it becomes an indispensable resource that everyone is responsible for sustaining.”

#### ETSY USES BLOOMFIRE TO SAVE OVER TEN THOUSAND HOURS ANNUALLY

Etsy is an e-commerce marketplace for handmade goods, vintage items, and supplies for making any craft imaginable. The community at Etsy.com is made up of independent creative businesses from around the globe looking to sell their crafty creations. This Brooklyn-based company has grown its community to more than 22 million members across 200 countries.

The Challenge

Etsy had struggled to find the right tool to help its ninety support agents on the Member Operations team share documents, ideas, and update content. Their engineers make regular changes and updates to Etsy.com, and leadership needed a way to quickly share the most up-to-date information and product screenshots with support agents.

“One of the main issues we encountered with our company wide ‘wiki’ was not being able to find the information we need to do our job,” said Jennifer Nishinaga, Etsy’s Training and Development Manager. “The portal was being used by everyone in the company so there was an abundance of duplicate and outdated content. It was extremely difficult to locate the information that our support agents needed in order to answer our members’ questions.”

> It was extremely difficult is equivalent to we don't have a way to search, thus let's put it in a different system which we know.

The team began looking for a collaboration tool that would house all of their reference content and give them the ability to interact socially. They needed a tool where they could not only upload content, but was also easily searchable and where the document could be quickly edited as needed.

“It was very important that we didn’t get into versioning wars,” said Nishinaga. “We need to be able to edit on-the-fly and access the latest version of the document.”

> Wouldn't that particular editing be useful in the context of the original document as well?

Why Bloomfire

Etsy looked at a variety of different tools, and ultimately chose Bloomfire to solve their knowledge problem. It’s being used as a training and documentation portal that is maintained by senior members of the Member Operations team.

“We felt it fit our goal of creating a centralized portal for member operations and the UI is intuitive. We also liked the added features of notifications, following authors/members, and *seeing who has viewed a post/series*” said Nishinaga.

*They liked that Bloomfire makes it easy to post and search for product screenshots.*

“For example, our mobile application looks different on various types of phones. Bloomfire is useful because our engineers and product management team can post the latest screenshots everytime we launch a new version. That way, our support team can confidently troubleshoot knowing that the screen they are viewing is identical to what the caller is looking at,” Nishinaga said.

Results

*Etsy is using Bloomfire as a training and documentation portal for our Member Operations team. They like that agents can subscribe to notifications and access new and updated posts relevant to their area of specialization. They appreciate the ability to see who has looked at a post so that the training team can hold agents accountable.*

“Agents are adding comments and questions every day, as well as spending time in the portal during their down time,” said Nishinaga. “*They check Bloomfire first for answers when a question or issue arises.* We’re continually adding and updating content so that our agents can quickly and efficiently serve our members needs.”

“With a fast-growing company like Etsy, we’re finding it more difficult to locate relevant and updated documentation internally. We are also expanding internationally and need to provide those abroad with current information even if we’re not in the same time zone to answer questions live. Bloomfire is our constantly evolving online manual for all of our support operations.”

“Our support agents are saving two to three hours a week thanks to Bloomfire,” she said.

Nishinaga estimates that Etsy is saving a total of over ten thousand hours of wasted time each year by using Bloomfire.

#### How to Build an Onboarding Plan for a New Hire

With the economy on the upswing, many growing companies are starting to go after talented new employees. *That means a lot of first days on the jobs, and lot of time and money to spend while new staffers get up to speed. What if you could shrink the time it takes for an employee to reach his or her full potential?*

That's the promise of a growing trend in human-resources management called onboarding; its advocates describe it as a comprehensive approach to bringing on new hires that goes beyond simple orientation. Onboarding plans are intended to make new employees familiar with the overall goals of a company and support them as they embark on early projects all in an effort to achieve the perception of success (and productivity) quickly. The ultimate payoff is to reduce turnover and encourage workers to stay with an organization for a longer tenure.

> onboarding is seen as a HR initiative which involves planning, going beyond orientation (which is an event).

'It's really about calculating the cost of hiring new workers to the business,' says John Sullivan, former chief talent officer for Agilent Technologies and a professor of management at San Francisco State University. 'Companies need new hires to be productive and, at a small company especially, every employee counts.'

Here's a look at how your company can set up an onboarding process *to shorten the learning curve for new hires.*

Onboarding a New Hire: Plan Ahead

Think onboarding begins on an employee's first day? Wrong. A successful onboarding program actually begins during the recruitment and hiring process, says Erin Perry, director of client solutions at Pinstripe, a recruiting company based in Brookfield, Wisconsin. An onboarding process is linked to and in some ways starts with the employer brand that you create to attract people who are the right fit for your company's overall goals. 'If you're a high tech organization that has a cool brand and that uses social media and talks about innovation when you're advertising to attract new associates, that's great," Perry says. "But if on a new hire's first day you hand them 15 different forms to fill out, your employment brand message has just died."

Experts suggest you begin the orientation process before a candidate is formally hired by including ample information about your workplace and your culture in the Careers section on your website. 'The orientation should begin at the first click of the mouse when someone first goes on the company's website, so by the time the person comes in for the interview, they already know quite a lot about the organization,' says Richard Jordan, a business coach who has been responsible for reshaping the recruiting and orientation process at a number of technology firms. That way, you are more likely to attract candidates who are more engaged with your company's goals and culture and are more likely to become highly productive employees.

A new hire will surely be required to fill out a lot of new paperwork, so why not get a head start? Many companies choose to send necessary legal forms along with a formal offer letter. You can also send an employee handbook ahead of time, so that new staff members aren't overwhelmed with information on the first day.

> employee handbook. I am trying to recognize industry terms I assume US people are accustomed to.

HR software and other related applications can also be deployed ahead of time. *Automated systems are especially useful because onboarding requires the involvement of multiple departments within a company, all working together to welcome and engage a new employee, to make him or her feel as comfortable as possible from Day One.* The right technology can help coordinate various individuals and tasks by taking care of paperwork electronically, or sending notifications alerting IT support staff to configure a new hire's laptop and BlackBerry.

> onboarding is seen as configuring a laptop and a blackberry? It might be, but it goes beyond this. And being comfortable on the first day doesn't correlate with anything. It's outside of the company's control whether the employee feels comfortable or not. You are thinking about physical stuff instead of the actual experience. onboarding is an experience

Technology can also be an effective way to socialize your new hire into your company's organizational culture, Perry says. *On a company Intranet, you can make available to a new hire multimedia such as video and podcasts that state your company's overall strategic goals, talk about your company's values, and provide employee testimonials. As a bonus, these videos can feature company leaders, which will help introduce key players, cutting down on the endless name game that typically happens on an employee's first day.*

> It depends on the type of company you are trying to build. But the type of information they say they should present "strategic goals, company values, employee testimonials" is valuable.

Onboarding a New Hire: On the First Day, Nail the Details

*The prospect of the first day on the job is nerve-wracking. New hires are eager to impress their new bosses. So, if they don't know where the photocopier is or how to use it, chances are they aren't going to ask, and will waste time trying to figure the little things out for themselves. And if you throw a bunch of information at them, chances are they're not going to remember most of it. With an effective onboarding program, you should aim to present basic information in an easy-to-digest fashion, so that a rookie can turn to the more demanding aspects of his or her job.*

> Now we are getting somewhere. Are your employees first day nerve-wracking? It's a hard thing to recognize because it's outside of your control.

The way to do that is to consider the small, logistical details that add up to a sense of comfort and familiarity one has in a workplace. This is good not just for a new hire's peace of mind, but also for the overall health and well-being of your business. 'If a person is new and doesn't know how to use the phone system and accidentally hangs up on a potential client, that client is not going to care that they were new,' says John Sullivan. 'They're just going to be angry.'

Here's a list of things you should have ready by the time your new hires walk in the door:

Send out an e-mail to everyone in the office so they're prepared to welcome a new employee.
Get the new worker a security badge if he or she needs one.
Provide a name plate on his or her desk or office door as a tangible sign that you've prepared the space.
Set up the computer.
Configure the new employee's e-mail accounts.
Provide guides for any necessary software he or she will be using.
Set up his or her phone system, and provide instructions for using voicemail.
Have a stack of business cards waiting.
And here's a list of questions you should answer for the new employee voluntarily:

What should he or she bring? (Telling them to bring two forms of ID to verify paperwork is a good idea.)
Where should he or she park?
Who should he or she ask for in the lobby?
Where are the restrooms?
Where is the copy machine? (And how does it work?)
Where is the cafeteria?
Who should the employee talk to if he or she has additional questions? (It's a good idea to assign a co-worker or a hiring manager as a mentor to check-in with the new hire throughout at least the first week.)
A new employee's immediate supervisor should also be present on the first day. 'The worst thing you can do is have new hires show up when their immediate supervisor isn't there for three or four days,' Sullivan says. 'It's like getting married and not having your spouse on your honeymoon.'

> I don't think it matters that much to show people where the bathroom is. Why don't you use signs on the wall? Onboarding has to be about more than showing where the cafeteria is. Maybe I am looking at the wrong side of the story

Dig Deeper: Mastering a New Employee's First Day

Onboarding a New Hire:  Individualizing the Process

Unlike a traditional first-day orientation, where an employee generally spends a good chunk of time signing forms for Human Resources and reviewing the policies of the organization, onboarding is intended to be a multi-faceted approach. And while the list of things to consider for a new hire's first day applies to pretty much any employee, that doesn't mean you should forget about the unique needs of each individual. Quite the opposite, in fact.

For example, different people prefer different management styles, so why not ask a new employee from the start how he or she wants to be managed? 'Onboarding is a performance-based, customized approach,' Sullivan says. 'Why don't ask you upfront what is the best way to manage you?'

A more personal element to the process can engage new employees, giving them the ability to identify their personal goals with the overall success of the organization. Ari Weinzweig, CEO of the Zingerman's Community of Businesses, a group of food specialty businesses in Ann Arbor, Michigan, still personally teaches an orientation class to new staffers. 'By taking the time to teach the orientation, the clear message that comes across is that we value them and their work so highly that the head of the company is willing to sit with them to go over things,' he says.

Make sure a new staff member understands how he or she can individually contribute to the company. Explain to the employee how your performance appraisal system works, so he or she won't waste time on things that don't matter, and can quickly begin to work on key objectives. If you make a custom onboarding plan, 'you're leaving the individual with the impression that employees are very important assets to the organization, chosen from among many candidates, and that their talent and potential is recognized,' Jordan says. 'You want to make sure you develop their career path within the organization.'

How vested an employee feels to a company also has to do with the social relationships he or she makes with co-workers. An onboarding process should consider those relationships and facilitate them from the very beginning. Organize a lunch on the first day with the new employee's team or department the new employee. Or try giving your new employee a week's worth of gift certificates for lunch, so he or she can take a colleague to lunch each day.

Onboarding a New Hire: Following Through on Your Plan

On-boarding doesn't end on the Friday of a new employee's first week on the job. The process should continue over the span of several months and, during that time, it is essential to solicit feedback from all constituents. A good way to do that is to assign a recruiting manager to keep track of the new hire's first few months on the job, Jordan says, because that individual will already have developed a relationship with the employee.

'I'm a big believer of surveying at every step of the process,' Perry says. She suggests surveying at the end of the first week and at the close of each of the employee's first three months, asking different questions at each stage. Begin with questions about the recruiting process, how the first day met the employee's expectations, and whether they are struggling with any issues related to technology. Then, start asking whether the employee has the necessary tools to complete his or her job and, finally, begin asking about an employee's strategic goals. You want to learn how engaged or connected the new hire feels to the organization.

You also want to make sure someone is accountable, preferably a line manager who realizes the cost savings to the business if a new employee gets up to speed quicker. You want managers to be very aware that you are measuring productivity through metrics. Make sure employees actually are becoming productive and, if they are not, figure out what is going wrong. Continually fine-tune how you onboard employees to make sure you can maximize the benefits of the process.

Once you've done that, you can begin to establish a general checklist of what you want to cover when you're onboarding. Even within that structured plan or process, make sure you leave room for those personal touches. 'Your employees are going to get orientated whether you plan for it or not," Perry observes. "But if you do plan it, it's a lot more likely to be successful."

#### Experiment Board Tutorial with Grace Ng

Three methods to test assumptions: interview (get in front of customers and get answers), pre-sale (when you sell something before actually having it) and concierge (where you manually deliver the service for your customer)

http://kevindewalt.com/2013/01/21/bad-customer-development-questions-and-how-to-avoid-my-mistakes/

#### Bad Customer Development Questions and How to Avoid My Mistakes

Summary: Although Customer Development can give us tremendous insight into market problems, it takes a lot of time – time that’s wasted if we do it incorrectly. Worse yet, poorly worded questions can cause us to reach wrong conclusions about what people want. The best questions don’t require customers to speculate about their behavior. Here I share real examples my bad questions and mistakes and offer some better alternatives.

If you’re starting Customer Development you’re getting ready to talk to a lot of potential customers. You started with an an idea, wrote down your key assumptions, and started flipping through contacts to see who you can interview.

Awesome! You’re off to a great start. Talking face-to-face with customers brings us insight we can’t get from surveys and clicks.

Unfortunately, conducting face-to-face customer development interviews is a skill that takes practice. I’ve been doing it for 5 years and I’m still learning. So many times I’ve asked the wrong questions and later realized I was wasting time or – worse yet – coming to incorrect conclusions and building the wrong products.

“Learn Nothing” Questions

I call “Learn Nothing” questions those that don’t result in any learning, just wasted time.

“What do you think of my idea?”

I LOVE talking about startup ideas. To quote my friend Patrick Smith, “talking about startups is entertainment like sports”. Fun, yes. Validated learning? No.  What do you think of my startup idea? is useless because if my idea is great people will like it. If it sucks, surely some people will still like it.

“If you could wave a magic wand…”

I know Steve Blank calls this the “IPO question”. I call it the “sit back and watch people ramble about things I have no chance of building” question. I’ve asked this question at the end of meetings and – after some funny looks – watched somebody ramble. It just hasn’t worked for me.

“Can you tell me about your problems with medical bills?”

I asked this question a few times before realizing that asking people to talk about problems just results in venting and no learning. This is particularly true with complex, personal, emotionally charged problems like those in health care.  “Well there was this one time….and then…but what really got me mad…”

“False Positive” Questions

Wrong conclusions are worse than no learning at all, and I call “False Positive” questions those designed to get customers to tell us what we want to hear.

All of us want our product ideas to be right – I want it, you want it, Steve Jobs wanted it. While our enthusiasm is our biggest asset, it is dangerous in customer development because most people don’t want to disappoint us.

> +1 most people don't want to dissapoint us. Could I create questions which are designed to make people dissapoint us?

“I’m building a product to help people manage medical bills. Can you tell me…”

Any question that starts with the solution already biases people’s expectations. Someone hearing this question might focus on a minor problem they had with medical billing in the past and convince us that it is a major source of pain.

> Leading question, I will have to revise the structure of questions, but maybe a book on interogatory techniques might help. They do work at making people say what they want.

Better: Skip the “I’m building a…” intro.

“How do you reconcile your HSA account with your bills, receipts, and statements to make sure you’re optimizing future tax savings?”

The “How do you do something complex to achieve results” questions can put people on the defensive. You can imagine someone thinking, “You mean I’m supposed to be doing something with that paperwork to save money on taxes? Oh no, I’m such an idiot, what am I doing wrong?”

Of course customers will be biased to tell us they need help with something after we cause them to doubt their own competence.

> +1 it makes sense, guilty as charged. I thought this was the whole point to sell them something, make them realize they have a problem.

Better: “What do you do with that HSA paperwork?”

“Would you take a picture of a medical bill with your iPhone?”

This question sets up the prospective customer to tell us what we obviously want to hear.

Better questions would give us insight into how they currently work and whether the extra steps and inconvenience of using our products gives a promise of a big return.

Better: “Do you scan or file medical bills you get in the mail?”

> I can understand the difference, let me see how I can integrate this. Would you take a picture versus Do you scan. One is for a future behaviour and one is asking for current behaviour which is what we want to know about.

This question is better because it gives someone the opportunity to disappoint us without realizing it, what Rob Fitzpatrick calls the “mom test”.

In this case, suppose your key assumption is that managing bills via in iPhone app saves time over filing or scanning. Should they respond, “Scan them? I’m too busy for that, I don’t even open them,” you’ve just invalidated your whole company vision with one question.

The Key to Effective Customer Development

In retrospect, the root of my bad questions was that I only had an idea – I didn’t have specific hypothesis I was trying to validate. I tried to replace the hard work of documenting and testing assumptions with meetings and simply wasted time.

Always remember that Customer Development is a big commitment that takes a huge amount of time, time best spent on something else if you’re not doing it right.

Before you line up a bunch of meetings and spend weeks talking to people, take some time to carefully consider what you’re going to ask and why.  The key is to make sure your questions are designed to test your assumptions.  I write them down and you should too.  

Talk with your co-founders or advisers about your interview script. If you need help, I’m happy to review it with you.

#### Check yo’ Segment

When I’ve interviewed customers in the past and couldn’t quickly get a clear picture on their answers (i.e. interviewed more than 5 people and “everyone had different problems”) it was because I was interviewing people across customer segments.

I was interviewing *“small and medium sized businesses”* when I should have been interviewing, **“US law firms specializing in IP law with 5 – 25 lawyers, and who are LexisNexis customers.”**

I was interviewing *“friends and family members of people with ADHD”* when I should have been interviewing **“working age people with smart phones who live within 50 miles of US urban centers and within an hour of a sibling diagnosed with ADHD.”**

#### How to Interview your Customers

Interviewing Customers is a Special Kind of Torture

Talk to a stranger. Fun.
That stranger is immensely busy…and hates being sold things. Getting better.
That stranger will likely destroy your vision for a company. Ready to get started?!

When I started interviewing customers, the only thing I cared less about than talking about other people’s problems, was asking about them. So, I skipped all the questions I thought were BS, and jumped to the most important ones:

“Would you use a product that does _____________?” and “How much would you pay for it?”
Turns out, those aren’t the most important questions…they’re the most misleading. Apparently, I am not a natural interviewer.

When I realized interviewing customers meant standing in front of strangers doing something I was awful at, any enthusiasm I had towards “getting out of the building”, evaporated.

When I see other founders hesitate to interview customers, or do them wrong, I empathize. I’ve been there. It’s a daunting task we have no experience with – and – isn’t nearly as fun as building stuff.

Let’s Fix That

Despite my early misgivings, learning to interview customers has become one of my most indispensable skills. Not just because it gives me a leg up on competitors, not because it helps me (in)validate ideas quickly, and not because it helps in my personal life as much as it does my professional. It’s indispensable because…

For me, interviewing customers makes customer development…fulfilling.
Instead of being stressed about what the customer is going to think about my idea, instead of fumbling over my words and worrying about the perfect way to pitch my product, a customer interview isn’t about me, my product, or my words. It’s about theirs. All I have to do is listen. No pitching, no negotiating, just ask a handful of questions with a sincere interest to learn.

How Not to Interview

A few ground rules I use that will prevent you from torpedoing your interviews:

1st rule of validating your idea: Do not talk about your idea. Tweet this
tyler-fight-club-quote1 Your brain is hard wired to screw you as soon as you start thinking about your idea.

Once your idea pops into your brain during an interview, your body will literally turn against you. It will start looking for validation that the idea is good. Your interpretations of statements, intonation, body language will all be skewed. What’s worse, the person you’re talking to subconsciously knows what you’re looking for, and based on our desire to build relationships, will want to help you. They’ll be your unwitting accomplice and provide the  “validation” you’re looking for – leading you in the wrong direction. To the best of your abilities, avoid thinking about your idea during the interview – and certainly avoid talking about it. These interviews are about your customers and their problems. Do your best to keep the conversation focused there.

2nd rule of validating your idea: Do not ask about the future.
No hypotheticals, no projections, no guesses. The way I remember this rule? I never ask a question with the word “would” in it:

“If we built a product that solved X problem, would you use it?”
“How much would you pay for something that did X?”
“Would you like your existing solution better if it did X?”
When you use the word “would”, you’re making a thinly veiled attempt to validate your product…not their problem. Don’t do that. See Rule #1.



In addition, when you ask about the future, you’re asking your customer to predict it. She can’t do that. She’ll try, but she’ll be wrong. Listening to wrong answers can only serve to harm you (“75% of people I talked to said they wanted…”, “Half of the interviewees said they’d pay $20″, etc.) – they’re all bad guesses. There are better ways to answer those questions.

#### 16 Tips for Better Customer Interviews

Learn to stay quiet: The best interviews are 90% listening and 10% talking. Don’t feel like you need to talk.

> Added it to my post customer interview analysis

Have a plan: Create an interview script and stick to it. It’s okay to adjust the phrasing or add questions, but being able to compare interviews is critical.

> I don't understand why comparing is critical yet, it might be. But yes, sticking to a script is fine in the beginning

Separate target groups: Focus on one sector or market vertical at a time to get a consistent data point. For example, if you are to test the dentist vertical, ask the same questions to every dentist you meet.

Meet one prospect at a time: Your goal is to make them talk about their personal pains, not their employer’s. Keep it one-on-one.

> I wouldn't do two prospects at a time. I am struggling to do one, I can't do two-person

Meet face-to-face: The best interviews are done face-to-face. Interviews through Skype or by phone are acceptable, but you will miss a lot of the emotions and opportunities.

> Unless you record video if they allow you to

Choose your location: If you’re uncomfortable meeting with a high-ranked prospect (it happens), get him out of his office for lunch or coffee to even the odds. A neutral location will make you feel more comfortable, but it will also make some information impossible to collect. A following interview should be in their office.

Ask open questions: Who, what, when, where, why, and how, not yes/no questions. Dig deep and avoid closed questions.

> Why?

Follow emotion: Whenever you hear emotion in the person’s voice, prolong that line of conversation.
Record and take notes: You miss 50% of what’s being said during the interview if you’re taking notes. Record, take notes and re-listen to the interviews to gain new insights.

> Will do

Don’t judge: Your goal is to get as much information as possible in a limited time. It’s better to have more data than less; don’t disqualify the prospect during the meeting.

> Ok, but if the prospect is not qualified and I've made a mistake why should I waste (fill) his time?

Encourage complaints: Whenever the person starts complaining, listen. People are more specific with complaints than praise. Specific examples will really help you learn about the problems.

> If by listening you encourage complaints, so be it. I don't see the connection. But if you fallback to rule #1 you should listen.

Focus on actual behavior: People are not very good at predicting their own actions, knowing what they want, or knowing their true goals. Avoid what ifs. Ask about recent experiences.

> Keep it in the present or past, try to avoid future questioning

Bring a partner (sometimes): A two-person team can have one person leading the interview while the other takes notes. It might make your team appear more credible and will definitely accelerate share back with the team. Any more than two interviewers typically intimidate participants.

Parrot the answers: Repeat the answers back to your prospect for further clarifications and to validate your understanding. Do this by saying, “So what you’re saying is…”

> +1 without annoying the customer

Reference “other people”: Cindy Alvarez recommends challenging your pre-existing hypotheses by referencing “other people.” For example, “I’ve heard from other people that ______. Do you agree?” It’s easier for people to disagree with an anonymous third party than to disagree with you.

> +1 agreement statements

Smile: Be friendly and welcoming to make participants feel comfortable and get them to smile back.

> +1 :)

Enjoy!

#### Why Being a Great Salesman Hurts Your Customer Development Process

> This blog is awesome, the writing style is great, use of references and it caters to the way I perceive the world

Being too good of a salesperson can hurt your validation process.

Initially, learning and customer references should be prioritized over making money. You want prospects to honestly need and use your product.

Your plan is not to make money from the first clients. Money will be there later, so being generous with your early clients is an excellent idea.

It’s important for prospects to understand that you don’t have a product yet. You’re not just a regular vendor; you’re looking for a partnership more than just a sale.

You want to help them reach their objective, but in exchange, they must understand that you need to have product orders before anything gets built. That process must be clear.

Look, you have to understand that you’re getting in on the ground floor and for that, you’ll always be recognized as our first customer and I’ll always remember that. – Steve Smith, CakeMail Co-Founder

The worst thing you can do is to try to sell. You don’t know what your prospects want, you have no idea what the solution could be, and you don’t even know if the people you’re meeting are people you would like to sell to.

> +1. It's not like I know how to sale, but I can dig this logic

Find out what prospects really need to become clients.

With a good personal network, it is possible to ride relationships and land your first clients without really learning anything. However, riding relationships doesn’t lead to a scalable and repeatable model. At some point, even the best professional networks dry up.

> +1

Keep the sales tricks in your back pocket. Learn before selling if you truly want to build a business.

#### A Better Way to Interview Enterprise Customers

If you’re doing B2B Problem Interviews, I’ve got some tweaks to our traditional interview script that I’ve been using to great effect in the enterprise space. I wanted to pass them along.

Step 1: Define the Role

I now start off my B2B interviews with, “How do you describe your role?” I dig this question for 2 reasons:

It gives you both a common foundation to build on during the interview.
It gets the customer describing her world, using her words.
If you already know your customer’s role (e.g. job responsibilities) is, asking them to describe it gives you an easy way into the conversation while providing a shared context to work from for the rest of your interview.

If you don’t fully understand your customer’s role, asking her to use “her own words” gives you clearance to ask what might otherwise be an intimidating question.

“Oh, I’m not asking because I don’t know. I just want to hear you describe it.”
It’s her words you’ll use throughout the interview to establish an relationship. It’s her words you’ll use to demonstrate trust when asking for interviews with other B2B customers. And it’s her words you’ll use when it’s time to start pitching her a solution.

> Not a bad question either, but I don't think it's what I am supposed to ask though.

Step 2: Define Success

You’ve just asked about her role, now you want to know how to help her kill it in that role, so you ask, “What does success look like for you?”

You’re on the lookout for metrics used to evaluate her performance – both the measures her manager uses, and she uses. The success criteria she calls out is what we’re going to help her achieve!

Again pay attention to the words she uses – you’ll play these back again, verbatim, when it’s time for your solution interview.

> Ok, I agree with this one. It can be used afterwards in marketing

Step 3: Define the Problems

Now that you’ve established what success looks like to your customer, we want to find out the hardest part in achieving it. These “hard parts” are the problems we’re going to solve!

This is essentially the beginning of our traditional interview script, but now that you understand her role intimately, and what she’s striving for, you’ll have a fantastic context to ask in-depth questions from throughout the interview.

The key here is to tie any problems they mention to a specific success criteria so during your solution interview, you can draw a direct line from their problem, to your solution, and that results in their success criteria.

Using these three questions, in conjunction with the traditional interview script will provide the context, and the customer’s words, to set you up for success in your B2B solution interviews.

B2B Problem Interview Script
1. How do you describe your role?
2. What does success look like for you?
3. What’s the hardest part about achieving that success?
4. Can you tell me about the last time that happened?
5. Why was that hard?
6. What, if anything, have you done to solve that problem?
7. What don’t you love about the solutions you’ve tried?

What are solution interviews and how do you knock them out of the park? We’ll answer that in our next blog post. Subscribe here to get it! :)

http://firstround.com/review/the-only-onboarding-timeline-youll-need-from-offer-to-first-friday/

#### The Only Onboarding Timeline You’ll Need: From Offer to First Friday

At the start of 2013, Percolate Co-founder Noah Brier spoke to the company about its values and how it’d keep its culture intact through fast growth. By June, the startup had doubled its headcount to 60 people. When Brier referenced the presentation mid-year, he realized that half of the people in the room hadn’t heard it. *From then on, he knew he had to plan as much for his future employees as he did for his current team*. That meant thoughtfully designed onboarding.

With Percolate, Brier has built a marketing platform used by over 400 clients, including global brands such as Unilever, GE and MasterCard. Over nearly five years, the company has brought on more than 300 people across six offices. Brier’s creative chops from Fast Company and BusinessWeek have helped him build this team — and are arguably most evident in Percolate’s carefully crafted employee onboarding process.

*“Here’s what we’ve learned: your first week at a company has an outsized impact on how you feel about the organization, how you get yourself ramped up and how effective you will be,” he says. “It’s the foundation of your experience, capacity and emotional connection at work.”*

At First Round’s CEO Summit, Brier outlined the four principles that Percolate abides by when onboarding new employees. To show how they manifest in practice, he explains the company’s entire onboarding process in detail, from the moment employees sign their offer letters to when they finish their first week. For fast-growing startups that stress the importance of talent, here’s a blueprint to help integrate and motivate your newest employees.

Before jumping into the day-by-day onboarding plan at Percolate, it’s worth covering the key tenets that guide it. These ideas are embedded in how and why the company rolls out its onboarding process the way it does.

Write it all down. For six months in 2013, half the people at Percolate had not heard Brier speak about its values and lay out the year’s kick-off plan. He fixed this by designing a thorough onboarding program that’d get new people acquainted with the company and its culture as quickly as possible. *Key here was writing everything down. Nothing scales better or faster than words*. The average adult reads two to three times as fast as she listens. Plus, documentation is a ready resource, while people aren’t always available.*

Distribute decision-making. For Brier, culture is how you make decisions, and the first exhibit of your culture is onboarding. “It shows your shared set of values and how they help people make decisions that are in the best interests of the company,” says Brier. “You can't scale a company without trusting people to make decisions without you. If you're going to do that, you need to provide a framework for making decisions, because not just any decision will do. You want them to make good ones.” The new hire is introduced to our values through the entire onboarding process. From the Day 1 Document to the office tour to department specific meetings the new hire learns just how our values inform decision making.

Make onboarding everyone’s responsibility. If culture is ultimately a framework for making good decisions, then there’s a big return on giving resources to onboarding, when employees start to learn how those decisions are made. “The goal is to give them as much exposure as possible to good decision making in their early days,” says Brier. “That’s where shadowing and creating time for observation becomes critical. And you want to involve as many existing employees in demonstrating these decisions as you can.”

Be thoughtful by design. This is one of Percolate’s values and means carefully crafting every interaction with respect for whomever is on the other end. “Our third hire was our VP of Design, so we’re a very design-centric company. It's continued to be an important piece of what we do. More than just the graphics and aesthetics, it's about being conscientious about the experience that customers and employees have,” says Brier. “The best way to convey our deep care for design is to involve everyone in creating that experience. Internally, onboarding is our first — and perhaps most impactful — way of achieving that goal.”

An Onboarding Plan: From Offer Letter to First Friday

At Percolate, the best way to internally articulate its culture, guided by good design and crafted by everyone, is a structured onboarding plan. Here, Brier lays out the process his company uses for new hires, from the moment they agree to join to the end of their first week. The company is constantly refining its process, but this has been its plan over the last few years.

Offer Letter Signed

Before the employee walks into the office, Percolate provides a lifeline and branded swag for the employee. This gives support to the new hire and demonstrates its brand and values. “Within 48 hours of receiving the signed offer letter, each hire receives a welcome email, establishing a point person to answer any questions and gather basic information via a ‘Welcome to Percolate’ survey. This assists us in preparing for the employee’s arrival,” says Brier. “In parallel, we send a welcome package — including a t-shirt, coffee mug, granola, tote bag and handwritten ‘congratulations’ letter.”

Most notably, each new hire receives a Kindle. “That's linked to a core idea that we are a learning organization. It's our responsibility to help encourage people to continue to read and make themselves better,” says Brier. “They can read whatever they want but personally I find the Kindle to be a pretty amazing device for continuing to find new ideas in the world.

Two Weeks Before Start Date

Each remote new hire — who’s based outside of New York — is provided with travel and accommodation details that have been arranged and purchased. Brier explains, “We bring everybody into New York. At our size and footprint, I'm not sure this will continue forever, but for now, we get everyone in to spend their first week in NYC.”

One thing that Percolate learned early on, especially opening new offices is that you have to export culture. “It's the only way it works. The first time that we tried to open an office outside New York we tried to do it without sending anyone from New York (our headquarters at the time),” says Brier. “That was a challenge. We learned that you have to export your culture by sending people who are already steeped in the way the company works out to new places. And not just regular people — but your best ambassadors — to make sure that culture continues to be built in the right kind of way.”

The Friday Before The New Hire Arrives

The Friday before the new hire starts, they get access to their email and a very full schedule for her first two days at work. “I know there are different schools of thought about onboarding schedules. Generally, we try to over-schedule instead of under-schedule for new employees,” says Brier. “In my own personal experience, it’s a weird feeling to show up on the first day and not having any work or idea of what to do. So we fill those days as much as possible.”

In summary, here’s the key information that’s delivered to new hires before their first week:

Practical instructions, including email login, arrival time and FAQs
Day One document (more below), a digital embodiment of Percolate’s culture
Email introduction to a “Percolator,” an employee who will reach out to welcome the new hire and act as another point person for questions and guidance
People Ops onboarding calendar, which outlines the first two days of meetings and Asana tasks for their first week
Default to filling new hires’ calendars. Don’t leave them with the feeling that you’re surprised that they showed up.
First Monday

New Digs. Percolate sets up the desks of new hires so that there’s no need to search for supplies. Standard issued items, such as a computer, monitor, notebook and pens, are laid out. “You walk in the door and you've got a desk full of everything that you need to get started,” says Brier. “One of the things that I've seen done poorly is when new hires need to wait until 2 o'clock to get their laptop. Obviously, that's the first thing everybody wants to set up and get going.”

An employee’s workspace is an opportunity to reinforce its strong design aesthetic and place in a broader community. In addition to items in Percolate’s orange hue, the company uses the products and services from fellow First Round Capital-backed startups, such as Poppin which provides stylish office products and furnishings.

Introductions. Every Monday morning, Percolate has meetings for both the business and product teams. These weekly kick-offs are an opportunity to do a quick introduction of new hires. It’s meant to be fast, not comprehensive, so that faces can start to become familiar.

Everybody gives a brief introduction, so the focus shifts around the room, but it’s not unwieldy or too lengthy. “You just say who you are, where you from and what college you attended,” says Brier. “One of our VPs is a huge college basketball fan and likes to guess the mascot, which most of the time he nails.”

Headshots. Not every company does professional headshots, but it’s an important detail to Percolate. “It’s something we do and people seem to really appreciate it. We have a photographer, who takes headshots for everybody,” says Brier. “It’s important to be a part of a community, and one key to achieving that is appearing to be part of the tribe. So, if you go view a few Percolate employees’ LinkedIn pages, you’ll find they share a very similar headshot.”

Day One Document. Six months after founding Percolate, Brier wrote the original version of Percolate’s detailed documentation of the culture of the company. It lives in Google Docs and has evolved in the hands of his employees. “The Day One Document is a prime example of our belief in *writing everything down.* I think we’ve done well by over-documenting everything. *We find that words scale well, which is essential as people spend less time with you individually, if you’re a founder. With a document like this, your team can asynchronously learn and engage.*”

So what’s in a Day One Document? “There's a lot going on, and it’s as defined by what it is as by what it isn’t. It is not your HR read-through of your benefits,” says Brier. “It’s our living, breathing document that covers all aspects of our culture, from where the company comes from to our point of view on meetings. Mostly it’s about our culture, ideas and methodology. We try to focus on explanations, not rules. In fact there are just three listed rules at Percolate.”


Table of Contents and first page of the Day One Document

"The Rules" from the Day One Document

"Meetings" section of the Day One Document
Introduce Yourself Email. As outlined in the Day One Document, a hire sends an “Introduce Yourself” email at the end of the first day. It’s a scripted greeting to the company from the new hire sharing a bit of background and trivia. “*Everyone who starts with the company sends one out. It also includes a photo and a link to three questions on Barista, Percolate’s internal Q&A platform. The idea is that it’s not about just giving information, but starting an exchange with your new team,*” says Brier.

As Percolate uses Google Groups, the “Introduce Yourself” emails live on as an archive of — and inspiration for — every introduction sent by a new hire. “People go back and read them, for guidance, perspective or pure entertainment,” says Brier. “Early on, we encouraged people to share embarrassing photos for fun, but when we hit about 150 people, we thought it wise to move away from that prompt. So, we told people to include any snapshot, but embarrassing photos kept coming. Apparently, everyone was inspired by the old way. You can't totally control these things, but it works pretty well as a nice way for people to get to know each other.”


Examples of Introduce Yourself Emails
By The End of The First Week

After the first day, Percolate slots in departmental deep dives so that new hires get broad and meaningful exposure to the motivations and responsibilities of each team. “Every department presents throughout that first week,” says Brier. “That is something that I think is pretty important regardless of your position in the company. Whether you're an engineer or a designer, you get exposed to all of the other parts of the organization.”

There may be a few familiar onboarding meetings in this list, but here’s a few more specifics on how Percolate approaches new hires’ meeting with each of its groups:

People Operations. As this is the first group to interact with the new hire, this team typically provides an overview of its role, the facilities and general office culture. In a separate meeting, the team walks through benefits packages and enrollment.
IT. IT answers initial setup questions for all hardware and software given to the employee. They outline and offer support for any future technical problems.
Sales. Percolate’s sales team shares how it’s structured to most effectively make deals.
Design. The design team explains how it implements Percolate's brand via its mission: to create the best suite of products for marketers through a start-to-finish design process that inspires a collaboration. Given Percolate’s strong design culture, the group deconstructs each part of its mission. “One of those is ‘start-to-finish.’ We ask our designers to do everything from research all the way up to visual design,” says Brier.
Marketing. As a startup building marketing software, this meeting covers not only how Percolate brands itself, but also how and why it serves marketers.
Product Management. In this session, PMs explain the structure of the product team and Percolate’s approach to developing software. “Even if the new hire doesn’t need to know the technology stack that we use, we want all employees to be exposed to our technology,” says Brier. “In this meeting, we introduce the concept of the manager's versus the maker's schedule to educate every new hire on how to work with engineers. We get granular: don’t interrupt engineers, especially if they have headphones on.”
The comprehensive tour of each department reinforces Percolate’s principle that onboarding is everyone’s responsibility. This visibility also demonstrates how decision-making is distributed throughout the organization, and how each department presides over its purview. “Ultimately, these departmental deep dives are not just to show what each team does, but to expose the core philosophy of each group, and how it fits into the company’s overall mission.”

In-Between Time

In addition to meetings aimed at educating new hires about each team, Percolate schedules sessions to integrate new team members by jumpstarting relationships. Regardless of how casual they may seem, the company schedules them so as not to leave them to chance.

Coffee Break. Between the meetings with each department, new hires are trained to use Percolate’s espresso machine. “If you name your company after a coffee product then it's a requirement that you have good coffee products around. People tend to not necessarily know how to use it,” says Brier.

Walkabout. In between each session, a new hire is walking from room to room throughout the office. So each hire is assigned a “Percolator,” the new employee’s buddy for the week. To foster cross-team collaboration, the Percolator must be from a different department than that of the new hire. “This person checks in on you, takes you to lunch and introduces you to everyone. When we were small, Percolators would know everyone’s name,” says Brier. “Now that we’ve hit a critical mass, we’ve transferred the role to our office manager, who miraculously — regardless of how many people we add — continues to know each person’s name.”

Percolator lunch. During the first week, Percolators take new hires to the office’s favorite neighborhood restaurants to enjoy lunch and casually learn more about Percolate’s culture.

Time with the CEO to Conclude Onboarding

As the last of the big onboarding meetings, Brier takes the newest members of Percolate through the history, philosophy and culture of the company. He shares how the organization thinks about product-market fit and how that connects to its vision to build the system of record for marketing. Brier explains why the company documents everything and the new hires’ role in adding to that story.

“This presentation is probably 40 or 50 slides, but really it takes two hours. The goal is not a drawn-out monologue, but to spend time with them,” says Brier. “One of the things that I’ve realized as a founder is that when your company is really small, the percentage of time everybody gets to spend with you is pretty high. If you’re five people, everybody conceivably gets 20% of your time. That’s a lot harder at 200 employees. But founder connectedness is always paramount — especially at the beginning.”

Admittedly, much of what Brier explains will have been touched on in some way between when the hire signs the offer letter to when she finishes her first week. But his goal is not to be original, but to be resonant. “When it comes to your message — and certainly mission, vision and values — repeat yourself until you think you sound like a broken record. Then start repeating yourself some more. That's a good way to think about what your job is in building a culture and running a company.”

As you grow the company it’s important to remember that your time with people doesn’t scale. Focus on founder connectedness.
When Brier delivered his message about onboarding at the CEO Summit, he had just finished a quarter in which Percolate hired over 75 people — nearly a person a day. The company grew its headcount by 30%. So before onboarding, a significant contingent was unfamiliar with the company, let alone anything achieved the quarter before. That’s exactly why Percolate has developed an onboarding program to help immediately instill its history, culture and values in its new workforce. From an intriguing "Introduce Yourself" email to a well-designed new desk to the "Day One" document, Brier has made sure his new hires’ first impressions are impactful ones.

“Yes, remember that culture is the internal manifestation of your brand and that nothing scales better than words. But if you only take one thing, don't forget about founder connectedness, because from your perspective, you'll always feel more connected to your team than they will. Just sort of assume they're less connected to you than you think they are,” say Brier. “And that goes especially for the employees you’ve not yet hired. When you're growing fast, plan for them just as much as much as you're planning for your current team. They may not know their onboarding has started, but you must.”

> It's a great story to be shared and it looks great on the outside. Who knows how productive it actually is, how much of the story is retained and how their culture evolved.

http://firstround.com/review/This-Startup-Built-Internal-Tools-to-Fuel-Major-Growth-Heres-Their-Approach/

#### GET BUY IN

Of course, none of the effort or investment is worth it if you can’t get the people at your company to use the products that have been built for them. *Ensuring that people buy into internal tools is more than half the battle. As Percolate grew from 5 to 15 to 50 people it became more and more challenging to roll out new internal tools and keep everyone engaged.*

To get everyone onboard, Brier and his executive team did a lot of repeating. “I think this is true no matter what company you work at or what you're doing — you should repeat your mission, your vision, and everything else that is important so that people really internalize it.”

During every new hire’s onboarding, they spend their first week at Percolate getting exposed to the different tools that the company uses to communicate and get things done. It’s become a core part of the new hire experience. Of course, there are products that get used company-wide, and those that are only used on the team level. For the latter, the immediate manager carries the onboarding responsibilities.

*For example, to get everyone familiar with Barista, Day 1 training directs new hires to use the tool to send around an email to everyone introducing themselves and asking three questions. This gives everyone great exposure to the tool while also helping them answer questions they may have, says Brier.*

“I think the more that you can get your staff comfortable with the mindset that products are the most important thing, the better product you will build externally.”

http://firstround.com/review/the-tools-early-stage-startups-actually-need-to-understand-their-customers/

Many companies mistakenly build tools for themselves — instead of focusing entirely on their customers — because they understand themselves better than their customers. It's an easy trap,” says Reinhardt. “You should only be building your own tool if you've tried lots of others on the market and find that none of them will solve your problem. Only build if you’re left without a choice. And still take care: *I’d estimate that 50% of the startups that I see build tools can’t maintain them.”*

If you’ve done your research and decide to build, go in with eyes wide open. “Building your own analytics tools in lieu of unleashing all your resources to build your product can be dangerous. It can easily kill a startup,” says Reinhardt. *“Say you have three engineers and one of them is working on building your analytics tool. Your ability to develop your product is now cut by 30% so you need 30% more runway. That analytics tool is lot more expensive to build than it seems. Being capable of building something doesn't mean that you should.”*

If it’s not vendor research, the most simple and impactful preparation is simply to write down the objective — even if it is in hypothesis form — before testing the tool. “Enter the tool selection process with an attitude of confidence that comes from experimentation. It may seem apparent, but I’m shocked by how many companies forget this step because the are rushing to make a decision,” says Reinhardt. “Here’s an example: ‘Our goal in using the analytics tool is for our product team to have a complete picture of the activation funnel.’ In this case, define what 60%, 80% or 100% of a complete picture of the customer might look like at various stages of success with the tool. Test it with your data, and, at the end of two weeks, declare whether it hit mark. This setup will help you find the winner or keep you moving.”

> I like how he set an objective goal similar to increase team collaboration by 10%

#### Calculate the full cost of the tool.

Sticker price is only the beginning. *Quantifying time saved and opportunity cost gives a more realistic approximation of the true cost of a tool.* “There was a point in Segment’s history where we we had only three months of runway left. It was a very scary time and we ran through all of the scenarios to survive if we weren’t able to fundraise,” says Reinhardt. “Compared to people, tools were a small fraction, but we couldn’t part with either, even in our desperate situation. *It was because tools allowed us to save time, and that was hugely valuable.”*

Reinhardt and Segment compare the cost of a tool to the dollar value of their time. “Tools not only save us money on hourly cost, but also accelerate our work,” says Reinhardt. “Say you are assessing your time at $50 per hour and buying MailChimp at $100 per month will save you building an e-mail distribution tool. That’s clearly worth it. So for us, it was getting disciplined about measuring the tradeoff between our time and budget.”

That’s even before calculating opportunity cost. “In retrospect, it can be enormous,” says Reinhardt. “If the company succeeds then you're going to end up valuing your time a lot more than the $30,000 dollars a year you might be paying yourself. It’s harder to quantify given how highly variable it is, but it can tip the scale if you are making a 50/50 decision.”

If you are truly paralyzed in purchasing a tool or service, take solace in the fact that most contracts for these tools are far less aggressive than, say, your mobile plan. “I structure the deal with vendors to pay monthly, but pretty much all these vendors will do that by default, especially for a startup that’s pre-product-market fit,” As companies get bigger they’ll ask for annual contracts, but at that point, it’s not a big deal,” says Reinhardt. “The bigger deal is getting locked in; that is real. Say you start sending your data to a tool and six months later you discover you were using the wrong tool. What you actually need is that data in another tool. It's getting very difficult to untangle yourself, because you've installed tracking code all over the place.”

Switching cost is a variable to factor into the total expense of a tool. “Again, through the course of an early-stage startup, a company will use several tools in each of eight or so different categories. For example, your data must graduate from different analytics tools as your startup grows,” says Reinhardt. “Don’t get entangled in a tool that you don't want to use anymore or that your company has outgrown. One way to do that is to make sure that you are separating data collection from the tools that receive the data.”

Your expectation for each of these tool categories is that they are instrumented with your data and deliver insights that change how you make decisions. “That could be making choices faster, in a more informed way, or more collaboratively with your team or customers. If you have a tool running the background, but you’re never looking at it, it’s not valuable.”

*Success comes from implementing a tool, using it and making decisions with the data it’s serving up to you.
It’s enough of a challenge to structure and disentangle data; there’s no reason to have the same complications with the tools you use to manage it. *

#### Workato Chat Bot Brings Enterprise Workflow Into Slack

As we head into 2016, enterprise chat applications like Slack are suddenly a hot commodity, and if you’re inside chat a good portion of the day the argument goes, you should be able to access other work without leaving the chat client. This is exactly what Workato’s newly announced chat bot, Workbot, is designed to do.

> Yes, alt+tab-ing is not an option anymore because you loose focus #laughing

Chat bots are small programs that integrate with a chat platform and provide some advanced type of functionality in a fairly easy fashion. The new Workbot-chat bot enables users to access and control over 100 enterprise applications such as a Salesforce CRM record, Quickbooks accounting information or Zendesk customer service interactions directly inside of Slack.

> Great, at least it can disseminate information which was not previously available to people without CRM access

One of the primary issues with early Enterprise 2.0 tools was that they were just another application busy employees needed to pay attention to. The idea here is to give users customer information directly in the context of the discussion they may be having with a fellow employee in an integrated fashion (or to simply get the information from the bot without prompting).

> Information will become stale in the chat records and it's not like Salesforce is chat ... What type of business are these guys trying to build?

“One of the things we saw in early collaboration tools like Yammer or Salesforce Chatter was that after initial hype that we have a new tool and we don’t have to do email, people eventually got resentful that these tools became one more feed you needed to pay attention to and take care of,” Anshu Sharma, venture partner at Storm Ventures, one of Workato’s investor’s explained.

> They don't need to pay attention to anything, attention is rather expensive, they need to figure out if the information is relevant when they need it.

The idea behind Workato’s Workbot is to let employees interact directly with enterprise applications that matter to them inside the chat client — and bring a level of automation to that. It’s worth noting that it requires a certain language to get that information (much like you have to ask the Amazon Echo a question just the right way), but it’s also possible to create connections to enterprise apps with simple aliases like ‘customer info’ to reduce the amount of typing.

> The business is asking questions and receiving answers from various platforms inside your Slack. Information is spread across various stores and you need your answer in context. When a screenshot doesn't help you can do this.

The tool has three main tasks. First of all, it can provide users with a full view of the customer inside of Slack, pulling the information from various customer information sources, but it’s not just a pure integration tool. It also provides a level of intelligence to the data by filtering more important information such as ticket priority, customer location or past due invoices. Finally, customers can define triggers so that if a certain threshold is met such as x number of outstanding support tickets, the customer service manager would get a message from Workbot inside of Slack automatically.

> It's not clear why are they doing this. And this type of article might be just another sponsored one. Don't you have these types of alerts in ticketing systems? Why are you trying to grab their attention and deciding what they should be working on?

Workato is a company concentrating on simplifying enterprise integration. Instead of using expensive or complex enterprise workflow or integration tools, Workato’s goal has been to simplify the process so that non-technical end users could create integrations on their own, putting together “recipes” that created workflows, like IFFT has done on the consumer level.

> Did a PR agency write this? It's IFFT for the enterpise #think #laughing

This isn’t the first time companies have tried to integrate enterprise applications inside a messaging tool. We have seen it extensively in email  with many companies trying to integrate inside of Microsoft Outlook.

What’s more, in the early part of this century there was a short-lived attempt to make enterprise instant messaging clients  the center of our work lives, a vision that didn’t quite come to fruition.

It’s also worth noting that Facebook is trying something similar for consumers inside Messenger.

Workato also announced a private beta of Workbot for HipChat.

#### TMW DEPLOYS BLOOMFIRE FOR INTRANET AND SOCIAL LEARNING

TMW Systems is a transportation management systems and trucking software provider who is making their transportation customers more efficient and profitable. TMW helps make the most of available capacity, bringing workflow automation and powerful business intelligence to the complex world of logistics operations and fleet management. Based in Cleveland, TMW employs 700 people, with satellite offices across the U.S. and Canada.

A Need to Socialize Knowledge

In 2014, TMW was changing rapidly; there were a lot of new employees coming on board. With a large percentage of employees primarily using email to share information, the company was finding that a lot of institutional knowledge was getting lost. By the end of the year, they decided it was the right time for a better social learning solution.

John Kittinger is the Internal Training Team Lead at TMW Systems, responsible for onboarding new employees and facilitating internal knowledge sharing.

“We needed a way to capture what our experienced employees know and distribute it to everyone else,” Kittinger said. “We also wanted to streamline information sharing in our support process to record best practices for future reference – rather than tracking down answers to the same questions over and over again.”

The Search for the Right Social Learning Solution

The company already had SharePoint and NetSuite, and they considered using each to solve their knowledge management problem. They also looked at open source wikis, CrowdBase, Jive, Confluence, SmartSupport, Evernote and Google Docs. In the end, their decision came down to two solutions: SharePoint and Bloomfire.

“If we had chosen SharePoint, we would have had to hire a developer to build something from the ground up,” Kittinger said. “We needed something our employees could pick up and use right away.”

“Bloomfire is tailor-made for both knowledge management and social learning; it’s also easy to use. Bloomfire was a perfect fit,” said Kittinger.

A Thoughtful and Measured Rollout of Bloomfire

TMW began using Bloomfire in September 2014. They uploaded materials and presentations from their annual user conference to seed the community with content. The company is organized into industry verticals and Kittinger seeded the community by going vertical by vertical to identify important documents to include in Bloomfire. He then did targeted training with the management and employees of each division to show them how to use Bloomfire to capture knowledge and encourage social learning. TMW focused on rolling out Bloomfire to customer-facing employees in sales and support. By early January, they had 300 users on Bloomfire.

TMW primarily uses Bloomfire to share information about their products, including tips and tricks, releases, and new features. They lean heavily on the question and answer engine as a replacement for email so that this knowledge is captured and accessible to anyone.

“People like the ease of use and the ability to share multi-media content. The search engine has been a big win since, in the past, we had documents that were forever lost in random places on shared network drives,” Kittinger said.

Bloomfire is also now part of the onboarding process. New employees attend a formal two-week training class where they learn about TMW’s products. In the past, everyone received a full three-inch binder with product information. That information has now moved into Bloomfire.

“We’re working to create a seamless transition between our formal training and on-the-job training,” said Kittinger. “We’ve integrated Bloomfire into our live training classes and we encourage new employees to take advantage of it for their informal social learning as well.”

A Cultural Shift to Become More Open and Collaborative

Kittinger says that Bloomfire is part of a significant cultural change at TMW, as the organization moves to become more open and collaborative.

“It’s opened up new ways of thinking about how we share information,” he said. “We’re giving our employees the confidence to know that there is one place to look. If an answer exists, it should be in Bloomfire. If they find it somewhere else, they know it’s their responsibility as a member of the community to share what they’ve learned in Bloomfire so that it’s there for the next person,” Kittinger said.

TMW’s end-goal is to build a self-sustaining community, so engagement is the most important metric they are tracking. During the first two months of 2015, 78 percent of users viewed content, and 32 percent had contributed, hi-fived, or commented. In addition, 87 percent of questions in the community have been answered.

“We want to incent users to add useful content to the community,” Kittinger said. “And we’re continuing to integrate Bloomfire into our employees’ flow of work so that it becomes an indispensable resource that everyone is responsible for sustaining.”

#### ETSY USES BLOOMFIRE TO SAVE OVER TEN THOUSAND HOURS ANNUALLY

Etsy is an e-commerce marketplace for handmade goods, vintage items, and supplies for making any craft imaginable. The community at Etsy.com is made up of independent creative businesses from around the globe looking to sell their crafty creations. This Brooklyn-based company has grown its community to more than 22 million members across 200 countries.

The Challenge

Etsy had struggled to find the right tool to help its ninety support agents on the Member Operations team share documents, ideas, and update content. Their engineers make regular changes and updates to Etsy.com, and leadership needed a way to quickly share the most up-to-date information and product screenshots with support agents.

“One of the main issues we encountered with our company wide ‘wiki’ was not being able to find the information we need to do our job,” said Jennifer Nishinaga, Etsy’s Training and Development Manager. “The portal was being used by everyone in the company so there was an abundance of duplicate and outdated content. It was extremely difficult to locate the information that our support agents needed in order to answer our members’ questions.”

> It was extremely difficult is equivalent to we don't have a way to search, thus let's put it in a different system which we know.

The team began looking for a collaboration tool that would house all of their reference content and give them the ability to interact socially. They needed a tool where they could not only upload content, but was also easily searchable and where the document could be quickly edited as needed.

“It was very important that we didn’t get into versioning wars,” said Nishinaga. “We need to be able to edit on-the-fly and access the latest version of the document.”

> Wouldn't that particular editing be useful in the context of the original document as well?

Why Bloomfire

Etsy looked at a variety of different tools, and ultimately chose Bloomfire to solve their knowledge problem. It’s being used as a training and documentation portal that is maintained by senior members of the Member Operations team.

“We felt it fit our goal of creating a centralized portal for member operations and the UI is intuitive. We also liked the added features of notifications, following authors/members, and *seeing who has viewed a post/series*” said Nishinaga.

*They liked that Bloomfire makes it easy to post and search for product screenshots.*

“For example, our mobile application looks different on various types of phones. Bloomfire is useful because our engineers and product management team can post the latest screenshots everytime we launch a new version. That way, our support team can confidently troubleshoot knowing that the screen they are viewing is identical to what the caller is looking at,” Nishinaga said.

Results

*Etsy is using Bloomfire as a training and documentation portal for our Member Operations team. They like that agents can subscribe to notifications and access new and updated posts relevant to their area of specialization. They appreciate the ability to see who has looked at a post so that the training team can hold agents accountable.*

“Agents are adding comments and questions every day, as well as spending time in the portal during their down time,” said Nishinaga. “*They check Bloomfire first for answers when a question or issue arises.* We’re continually adding and updating content so that our agents can quickly and efficiently serve our members needs.”

“With a fast-growing company like Etsy, we’re finding it more difficult to locate relevant and updated documentation internally. We are also expanding internationally and need to provide those abroad with current information even if we’re not in the same time zone to answer questions live. Bloomfire is our constantly evolving online manual for all of our support operations.”

“Our support agents are saving two to three hours a week thanks to Bloomfire,” she said.

Nishinaga estimates that Etsy is saving a total of over ten thousand hours of wasted time each year by using Bloomfire.

#### How to Build an Onboarding Plan for a New Hire

With the economy on the upswing, many growing companies are starting to go after talented new employees. *That means a lot of first days on the jobs, and lot of time and money to spend while new staffers get up to speed. What if you could shrink the time it takes for an employee to reach his or her full potential?*

That's the promise of a growing trend in human-resources management called onboarding; its advocates describe it as a comprehensive approach to bringing on new hires that goes beyond simple orientation. Onboarding plans are intended to make new employees familiar with the overall goals of a company and support them as they embark on early projects all in an effort to achieve the perception of success (and productivity) quickly. The ultimate payoff is to reduce turnover and encourage workers to stay with an organization for a longer tenure.

> onboarding is seen as a HR initiative which involves planning, going beyond orientation (which is an event).

'It's really about calculating the cost of hiring new workers to the business,' says John Sullivan, former chief talent officer for Agilent Technologies and a professor of management at San Francisco State University. 'Companies need new hires to be productive and, at a small company especially, every employee counts.'

Here's a look at how your company can set up an onboarding process *to shorten the learning curve for new hires.*

Onboarding a New Hire: Plan Ahead

Think onboarding begins on an employee's first day? Wrong. A successful onboarding program actually begins during the recruitment and hiring process, says Erin Perry, director of client solutions at Pinstripe, a recruiting company based in Brookfield, Wisconsin. An onboarding process is linked to and in some ways starts with the employer brand that you create to attract people who are the right fit for your company's overall goals. 'If you're a high tech organization that has a cool brand and that uses social media and talks about innovation when you're advertising to attract new associates, that's great," Perry says. "But if on a new hire's first day you hand them 15 different forms to fill out, your employment brand message has just died."

Experts suggest you begin the orientation process before a candidate is formally hired by including ample information about your workplace and your culture in the Careers section on your website. 'The orientation should begin at the first click of the mouse when someone first goes on the company's website, so by the time the person comes in for the interview, they already know quite a lot about the organization,' says Richard Jordan, a business coach who has been responsible for reshaping the recruiting and orientation process at a number of technology firms. That way, you are more likely to attract candidates who are more engaged with your company's goals and culture and are more likely to become highly productive employees.

A new hire will surely be required to fill out a lot of new paperwork, so why not get a head start? Many companies choose to send necessary legal forms along with a formal offer letter. You can also send an employee handbook ahead of time, so that new staff members aren't overwhelmed with information on the first day.

> employee handbook. I am trying to recognize industry terms I assume US people are accustomed to.

HR software and other related applications can also be deployed ahead of time. *Automated systems are especially useful because onboarding requires the involvement of multiple departments within a company, all working together to welcome and engage a new employee, to make him or her feel as comfortable as possible from Day One.* The right technology can help coordinate various individuals and tasks by taking care of paperwork electronically, or sending notifications alerting IT support staff to configure a new hire's laptop and BlackBerry.

> onboarding is seen as configuring a laptop and a blackberry? It might be, but it goes beyond this. And being comfortable on the first day doesn't correlate with anything. It's outside of the company's control whether the employee feels comfortable or not. You are thinking about physical stuff instead of the actual experience. onboarding is an experience

Technology can also be an effective way to socialize your new hire into your company's organizational culture, Perry says. *On a company Intranet, you can make available to a new hire multimedia such as video and podcasts that state your company's overall strategic goals, talk about your company's values, and provide employee testimonials. As a bonus, these videos can feature company leaders, which will help introduce key players, cutting down on the endless name game that typically happens on an employee's first day.*

> It depends on the type of company you are trying to build. But the type of information they say they should present "strategic goals, company values, employee testimonials" is valuable.

Onboarding a New Hire: On the First Day, Nail the Details

*The prospect of the first day on the job is nerve-wracking. New hires are eager to impress their new bosses. So, if they don't know where the photocopier is or how to use it, chances are they aren't going to ask, and will waste time trying to figure the little things out for themselves. And if you throw a bunch of information at them, chances are they're not going to remember most of it. With an effective onboarding program, you should aim to present basic information in an easy-to-digest fashion, so that a rookie can turn to the more demanding aspects of his or her job.*

> Now we are getting somewhere. Are your employees first day nerve-wracking? It's a hard thing to recognize because it's outside of your control.

The way to do that is to consider the small, logistical details that add up to a sense of comfort and familiarity one has in a workplace. This is good not just for a new hire's peace of mind, but also for the overall health and well-being of your business. 'If a person is new and doesn't know how to use the phone system and accidentally hangs up on a potential client, that client is not going to care that they were new,' says John Sullivan. 'They're just going to be angry.'

Here's a list of things you should have ready by the time your new hires walk in the door:

Send out an e-mail to everyone in the office so they're prepared to welcome a new employee.
Get the new worker a security badge if he or she needs one.
Provide a name plate on his or her desk or office door as a tangible sign that you've prepared the space.
Set up the computer.
Configure the new employee's e-mail accounts.
Provide guides for any necessary software he or she will be using.
Set up his or her phone system, and provide instructions for using voicemail.
Have a stack of business cards waiting.
And here's a list of questions you should answer for the new employee voluntarily:

What should he or she bring? (Telling them to bring two forms of ID to verify paperwork is a good idea.)
Where should he or she park?
Who should he or she ask for in the lobby?
Where are the restrooms?
Where is the copy machine? (And how does it work?)
Where is the cafeteria?
Who should the employee talk to if he or she has additional questions? (It's a good idea to assign a co-worker or a hiring manager as a mentor to check-in with the new hire throughout at least the first week.)
A new employee's immediate supervisor should also be present on the first day. 'The worst thing you can do is have new hires show up when their immediate supervisor isn't there for three or four days,' Sullivan says. 'It's like getting married and not having your spouse on your honeymoon.'

> I don't think it matters that much to show people where the bathroom is. Why don't you use signs on the wall? Onboarding has to be about more than showing where the cafeteria is. Maybe I am looking at the wrong side of the story

Dig Deeper: Mastering a New Employee's First Day

Onboarding a New Hire:  Individualizing the Process

Unlike a traditional first-day orientation, where an employee generally spends a good chunk of time signing forms for Human Resources and reviewing the policies of the organization, onboarding is intended to be a multi-faceted approach. And while the list of things to consider for a new hire's first day applies to pretty much any employee, that doesn't mean you should forget about the unique needs of each individual. Quite the opposite, in fact.

For example, different people prefer different management styles, so why not ask a new employee from the start how he or she wants to be managed? 'Onboarding is a performance-based, customized approach,' Sullivan says. 'Why don't ask you upfront what is the best way to manage you?'

A more personal element to the process can engage new employees, giving them the ability to identify their personal goals with the overall success of the organization. Ari Weinzweig, CEO of the Zingerman's Community of Businesses, a group of food specialty businesses in Ann Arbor, Michigan, still personally teaches an orientation class to new staffers. 'By taking the time to teach the orientation, the clear message that comes across is that we value them and their work so highly that the head of the company is willing to sit with them to go over things,' he says.

Make sure a new staff member understands how he or she can individually contribute to the company. Explain to the employee how your performance appraisal system works, so he or she won't waste time on things that don't matter, and can quickly begin to work on key objectives. If you make a custom onboarding plan, 'you're leaving the individual with the impression that employees are very important assets to the organization, chosen from among many candidates, and that their talent and potential is recognized,' Jordan says. 'You want to make sure you develop their career path within the organization.'

How vested an employee feels to a company also has to do with the social relationships he or she makes with co-workers. An onboarding process should consider those relationships and facilitate them from the very beginning. Organize a lunch on the first day with the new employee's team or department the new employee. Or try giving your new employee a week's worth of gift certificates for lunch, so he or she can take a colleague to lunch each day.

Onboarding a New Hire: Following Through on Your Plan

On-boarding doesn't end on the Friday of a new employee's first week on the job. The process should continue over the span of several months and, during that time, it is essential to solicit feedback from all constituents. A good way to do that is to assign a recruiting manager to keep track of the new hire's first few months on the job, Jordan says, because that individual will already have developed a relationship with the employee.

'I'm a big believer of surveying at every step of the process,' Perry says. She suggests surveying at the end of the first week and at the close of each of the employee's first three months, asking different questions at each stage. Begin with questions about the recruiting process, how the first day met the employee's expectations, and whether they are struggling with any issues related to technology. Then, start asking whether the employee has the necessary tools to complete his or her job and, finally, begin asking about an employee's strategic goals. You want to learn how engaged or connected the new hire feels to the organization.

You also want to make sure someone is accountable, preferably a line manager who realizes the cost savings to the business if a new employee gets up to speed quicker. You want managers to be very aware that you are measuring productivity through metrics. Make sure employees actually are becoming productive and, if they are not, figure out what is going wrong. Continually fine-tune how you onboard employees to make sure you can maximize the benefits of the process.

Once you've done that, you can begin to establish a general checklist of what you want to cover when you're onboarding. Even within that structured plan or process, make sure you leave room for those personal touches. 'Your employees are going to get orientated whether you plan for it or not," Perry observes. "But if you do plan it, it's a lot more likely to be successful."

#### Experiment Board Tutorial with Grace Ng

Three methods to test assumptions: interview (get in front of customers and get answers), pre-sale (when you sell something before actually having it) and concierge (where you manually deliver the service for your customer)

http://kevindewalt.com/2013/01/21/bad-customer-development-questions-and-how-to-avoid-my-mistakes/

#### Bad Customer Development Questions and How to Avoid My Mistakes

Summary: Although Customer Development can give us tremendous insight into market problems, it takes a lot of time – time that’s wasted if we do it incorrectly. Worse yet, poorly worded questions can cause us to reach wrong conclusions about what people want. The best questions don’t require customers to speculate about their behavior. Here I share real examples my bad questions and mistakes and offer some better alternatives.

If you’re starting Customer Development you’re getting ready to talk to a lot of potential customers. You started with an an idea, wrote down your key assumptions, and started flipping through contacts to see who you can interview.

Awesome! You’re off to a great start. Talking face-to-face with customers brings us insight we can’t get from surveys and clicks.

Unfortunately, conducting face-to-face customer development interviews is a skill that takes practice. I’ve been doing it for 5 years and I’m still learning. So many times I’ve asked the wrong questions and later realized I was wasting time or – worse yet – coming to incorrect conclusions and building the wrong products.

“Learn Nothing” Questions

I call “Learn Nothing” questions those that don’t result in any learning, just wasted time.

“What do you think of my idea?”

I LOVE talking about startup ideas. To quote my friend Patrick Smith, “talking about startups is entertainment like sports”. Fun, yes. Validated learning? No.  What do you think of my startup idea? is useless because if my idea is great people will like it. If it sucks, surely some people will still like it.

“If you could wave a magic wand…”

I know Steve Blank calls this the “IPO question”. I call it the “sit back and watch people ramble about things I have no chance of building” question. I’ve asked this question at the end of meetings and – after some funny looks – watched somebody ramble. It just hasn’t worked for me.

“Can you tell me about your problems with medical bills?”

I asked this question a few times before realizing that asking people to talk about problems just results in venting and no learning. This is particularly true with complex, personal, emotionally charged problems like those in health care.  “Well there was this one time….and then…but what really got me mad…”

“False Positive” Questions

Wrong conclusions are worse than no learning at all, and I call “False Positive” questions those designed to get customers to tell us what we want to hear.

All of us want our product ideas to be right – I want it, you want it, Steve Jobs wanted it. While our enthusiasm is our biggest asset, it is dangerous in customer development because most people don’t want to disappoint us.

> +1 most people don't want to dissapoint us. Could I create questions which are designed to make people dissapoint us?

“I’m building a product to help people manage medical bills. Can you tell me…”

Any question that starts with the solution already biases people’s expectations. Someone hearing this question might focus on a minor problem they had with medical billing in the past and convince us that it is a major source of pain.

> Leading question, I will have to revise the structure of questions, but maybe a book on interogatory techniques might help. They do work at making people say what they want.

Better: Skip the “I’m building a…” intro.

“How do you reconcile your HSA account with your bills, receipts, and statements to make sure you’re optimizing future tax savings?”

The “How do you do something complex to achieve results” questions can put people on the defensive. You can imagine someone thinking, “You mean I’m supposed to be doing something with that paperwork to save money on taxes? Oh no, I’m such an idiot, what am I doing wrong?”

Of course customers will be biased to tell us they need help with something after we cause them to doubt their own competence.

> +1 it makes sense, guilty as charged. I thought this was the whole point to sell them something, make them realize they have a problem.

Better: “What do you do with that HSA paperwork?”

“Would you take a picture of a medical bill with your iPhone?”

This question sets up the prospective customer to tell us what we obviously want to hear.

Better questions would give us insight into how they currently work and whether the extra steps and inconvenience of using our products gives a promise of a big return.

Better: “Do you scan or file medical bills you get in the mail?”

> I can understand the difference, let me see how I can integrate this. Would you take a picture versus Do you scan. One is for a future behaviour and one is asking for current behaviour which is what we want to know about.

This question is better because it gives someone the opportunity to disappoint us without realizing it, what Rob Fitzpatrick calls the “mom test”.

In this case, suppose your key assumption is that managing bills via in iPhone app saves time over filing or scanning. Should they respond, “Scan them? I’m too busy for that, I don’t even open them,” you’ve just invalidated your whole company vision with one question.

The Key to Effective Customer Development

In retrospect, the root of my bad questions was that I only had an idea – I didn’t have specific hypothesis I was trying to validate. I tried to replace the hard work of documenting and testing assumptions with meetings and simply wasted time.

Always remember that Customer Development is a big commitment that takes a huge amount of time, time best spent on something else if you’re not doing it right.

Before you line up a bunch of meetings and spend weeks talking to people, take some time to carefully consider what you’re going to ask and why.  The key is to make sure your questions are designed to test your assumptions.  I write them down and you should too.  

Talk with your co-founders or advisers about your interview script. If you need help, I’m happy to review it with you.

#### Check yo’ Segment

When I’ve interviewed customers in the past and couldn’t quickly get a clear picture on their answers (i.e. interviewed more than 5 people and “everyone had different problems”) it was because I was interviewing people across customer segments.

I was interviewing *“small and medium sized businesses”* when I should have been interviewing, **“US law firms specializing in IP law with 5 – 25 lawyers, and who are LexisNexis customers.”**

I was interviewing *“friends and family members of people with ADHD”* when I should have been interviewing **“working age people with smart phones who live within 50 miles of US urban centers and within an hour of a sibling diagnosed with ADHD.”**

#### How to Interview your Customers

Interviewing Customers is a Special Kind of Torture

Talk to a stranger. Fun.
That stranger is immensely busy…and hates being sold things. Getting better.
That stranger will likely destroy your vision for a company. Ready to get started?!

When I started interviewing customers, the only thing I cared less about than talking about other people’s problems, was asking about them. So, I skipped all the questions I thought were BS, and jumped to the most important ones:

“Would you use a product that does _____________?” and “How much would you pay for it?”
Turns out, those aren’t the most important questions…they’re the most misleading. Apparently, I am not a natural interviewer.

When I realized interviewing customers meant standing in front of strangers doing something I was awful at, any enthusiasm I had towards “getting out of the building”, evaporated.

When I see other founders hesitate to interview customers, or do them wrong, I empathize. I’ve been there. It’s a daunting task we have no experience with – and – isn’t nearly as fun as building stuff.

Let’s Fix That

Despite my early misgivings, learning to interview customers has become one of my most indispensable skills. Not just because it gives me a leg up on competitors, not because it helps me (in)validate ideas quickly, and not because it helps in my personal life as much as it does my professional. It’s indispensable because…

For me, interviewing customers makes customer development…fulfilling.
Instead of being stressed about what the customer is going to think about my idea, instead of fumbling over my words and worrying about the perfect way to pitch my product, a customer interview isn’t about me, my product, or my words. It’s about theirs. All I have to do is listen. No pitching, no negotiating, just ask a handful of questions with a sincere interest to learn.

How Not to Interview

A few ground rules I use that will prevent you from torpedoing your interviews:

1st rule of validating your idea: Do not talk about your idea. Tweet this
tyler-fight-club-quote1 Your brain is hard wired to screw you as soon as you start thinking about your idea.

Once your idea pops into your brain during an interview, your body will literally turn against you. It will start looking for validation that the idea is good. Your interpretations of statements, intonation, body language will all be skewed. What’s worse, the person you’re talking to subconsciously knows what you’re looking for, and based on our desire to build relationships, will want to help you. They’ll be your unwitting accomplice and provide the  “validation” you’re looking for – leading you in the wrong direction. To the best of your abilities, avoid thinking about your idea during the interview – and certainly avoid talking about it. These interviews are about your customers and their problems. Do your best to keep the conversation focused there.

2nd rule of validating your idea: Do not ask about the future.
No hypotheticals, no projections, no guesses. The way I remember this rule? I never ask a question with the word “would” in it:

“If we built a product that solved X problem, would you use it?”
“How much would you pay for something that did X?”
“Would you like your existing solution better if it did X?”
When you use the word “would”, you’re making a thinly veiled attempt to validate your product…not their problem. Don’t do that. See Rule #1.



In addition, when you ask about the future, you’re asking your customer to predict it. She can’t do that. She’ll try, but she’ll be wrong. Listening to wrong answers can only serve to harm you (“75% of people I talked to said they wanted…”, “Half of the interviewees said they’d pay $20″, etc.) – they’re all bad guesses. There are better ways to answer those questions.

#### 16 Tips for Better Customer Interviews

Learn to stay quiet: The best interviews are 90% listening and 10% talking. Don’t feel like you need to talk.

> Added it to my post customer interview analysis

Have a plan: Create an interview script and stick to it. It’s okay to adjust the phrasing or add questions, but being able to compare interviews is critical.

> I don't understand why comparing is critical yet, it might be. But yes, sticking to a script is fine in the beginning

Separate target groups: Focus on one sector or market vertical at a time to get a consistent data point. For example, if you are to test the dentist vertical, ask the same questions to every dentist you meet.

Meet one prospect at a time: Your goal is to make them talk about their personal pains, not their employer’s. Keep it one-on-one.

> I wouldn't do two prospects at a time. I am struggling to do one, I can't do two-person

Meet face-to-face: The best interviews are done face-to-face. Interviews through Skype or by phone are acceptable, but you will miss a lot of the emotions and opportunities.

> Unless you record video if they allow you to

Choose your location: If you’re uncomfortable meeting with a high-ranked prospect (it happens), get him out of his office for lunch or coffee to even the odds. A neutral location will make you feel more comfortable, but it will also make some information impossible to collect. A following interview should be in their office.

Ask open questions: Who, what, when, where, why, and how, not yes/no questions. Dig deep and avoid closed questions.

> Why?

Follow emotion: Whenever you hear emotion in the person’s voice, prolong that line of conversation.
Record and take notes: You miss 50% of what’s being said during the interview if you’re taking notes. Record, take notes and re-listen to the interviews to gain new insights.

> Will do

Don’t judge: Your goal is to get as much information as possible in a limited time. It’s better to have more data than less; don’t disqualify the prospect during the meeting.

> Ok, but if the prospect is not qualified and I've made a mistake why should I waste (fill) his time?

Encourage complaints: Whenever the person starts complaining, listen. People are more specific with complaints than praise. Specific examples will really help you learn about the problems.

> If by listening you encourage complaints, so be it. I don't see the connection. But if you fallback to rule #1 you should listen.

Focus on actual behavior: People are not very good at predicting their own actions, knowing what they want, or knowing their true goals. Avoid what ifs. Ask about recent experiences.

> Keep it in the present or past, try to avoid future questioning

Bring a partner (sometimes): A two-person team can have one person leading the interview while the other takes notes. It might make your team appear more credible and will definitely accelerate share back with the team. Any more than two interviewers typically intimidate participants.

Parrot the answers: Repeat the answers back to your prospect for further clarifications and to validate your understanding. Do this by saying, “So what you’re saying is…”

> +1 without annoying the customer

Reference “other people”: Cindy Alvarez recommends challenging your pre-existing hypotheses by referencing “other people.” For example, “I’ve heard from other people that ______. Do you agree?” It’s easier for people to disagree with an anonymous third party than to disagree with you.

> +1 agreement statements

Smile: Be friendly and welcoming to make participants feel comfortable and get them to smile back.

> +1 :)

Enjoy!

#### Why Being a Great Salesman Hurts Your Customer Development Process

> This blog is awesome, the writing style is great, use of references and it caters to the way I perceive the world

Being too good of a salesperson can hurt your validation process.

Initially, learning and customer references should be prioritized over making money. You want prospects to honestly need and use your product.

Your plan is not to make money from the first clients. Money will be there later, so being generous with your early clients is an excellent idea.

It’s important for prospects to understand that you don’t have a product yet. You’re not just a regular vendor; you’re looking for a partnership more than just a sale.

You want to help them reach their objective, but in exchange, they must understand that you need to have product orders before anything gets built. That process must be clear.

Look, you have to understand that you’re getting in on the ground floor and for that, you’ll always be recognized as our first customer and I’ll always remember that. – Steve Smith, CakeMail Co-Founder

The worst thing you can do is to try to sell. You don’t know what your prospects want, you have no idea what the solution could be, and you don’t even know if the people you’re meeting are people you would like to sell to.

> +1. It's not like I know how to sale, but I can dig this logic

Find out what prospects really need to become clients.

With a good personal network, it is possible to ride relationships and land your first clients without really learning anything. However, riding relationships doesn’t lead to a scalable and repeatable model. At some point, even the best professional networks dry up.

> +1

Keep the sales tricks in your back pocket. Learn before selling if you truly want to build a business.

#### A Better Way to Interview Enterprise Customers

If you’re doing B2B Problem Interviews, I’ve got some tweaks to our traditional interview script that I’ve been using to great effect in the enterprise space. I wanted to pass them along.

Step 1: Define the Role

I now start off my B2B interviews with, “How do you describe your role?” I dig this question for 2 reasons:

It gives you both a common foundation to build on during the interview.
It gets the customer describing her world, using her words.
If you already know your customer’s role (e.g. job responsibilities) is, asking them to describe it gives you an easy way into the conversation while providing a shared context to work from for the rest of your interview.

If you don’t fully understand your customer’s role, asking her to use “her own words” gives you clearance to ask what might otherwise be an intimidating question.

“Oh, I’m not asking because I don’t know. I just want to hear you describe it.”
It’s her words you’ll use throughout the interview to establish an relationship. It’s her words you’ll use to demonstrate trust when asking for interviews with other B2B customers. And it’s her words you’ll use when it’s time to start pitching her a solution.

> Not a bad question either, but I don't think it's what I am supposed to ask though.

Step 2: Define Success

You’ve just asked about her role, now you want to know how to help her kill it in that role, so you ask, “What does success look like for you?”

You’re on the lookout for metrics used to evaluate her performance – both the measures her manager uses, and she uses. The success criteria she calls out is what we’re going to help her achieve!

Again pay attention to the words she uses – you’ll play these back again, verbatim, when it’s time for your solution interview.

> Ok, I agree with this one. It can be used afterwards in marketing

Step 3: Define the Problems

Now that you’ve established what success looks like to your customer, we want to find out the hardest part in achieving it. These “hard parts” are the problems we’re going to solve!

This is essentially the beginning of our traditional interview script, but now that you understand her role intimately, and what she’s striving for, you’ll have a fantastic context to ask in-depth questions from throughout the interview.

The key here is to tie any problems they mention to a specific success criteria so during your solution interview, you can draw a direct line from their problem, to your solution, and that results in their success criteria.

Using these three questions, in conjunction with the traditional interview script will provide the context, and the customer’s words, to set you up for success in your B2B solution interviews.

B2B Problem Interview Script
1. How do you describe your role?
2. What does success look like for you?
3. What’s the hardest part about achieving that success?
4. Can you tell me about the last time that happened?
5. Why was that hard?
6. What, if anything, have you done to solve that problem?
7. What don’t you love about the solutions you’ve tried?

What are solution interviews and how do you knock them out of the park? We’ll answer that in our next blog post. Subscribe here to get it! :)

http://firstround.com/review/the-only-onboarding-timeline-youll-need-from-offer-to-first-friday/

#### The Only Onboarding Timeline You’ll Need: From Offer to First Friday

At the start of 2013, Percolate Co-founder Noah Brier spoke to the company about its values and how it’d keep its culture intact through fast growth. By June, the startup had doubled its headcount to 60 people. When Brier referenced the presentation mid-year, he realized that half of the people in the room hadn’t heard it. *From then on, he knew he had to plan as much for his future employees as he did for his current team*. That meant thoughtfully designed onboarding.

With Percolate, Brier has built a marketing platform used by over 400 clients, including global brands such as Unilever, GE and MasterCard. Over nearly five years, the company has brought on more than 300 people across six offices. Brier’s creative chops from Fast Company and BusinessWeek have helped him build this team — and are arguably most evident in Percolate’s carefully crafted employee onboarding process.

*“Here’s what we’ve learned: your first week at a company has an outsized impact on how you feel about the organization, how you get yourself ramped up and how effective you will be,” he says. “It’s the foundation of your experience, capacity and emotional connection at work.”*

At First Round’s CEO Summit, Brier outlined the four principles that Percolate abides by when onboarding new employees. To show how they manifest in practice, he explains the company’s entire onboarding process in detail, from the moment employees sign their offer letters to when they finish their first week. For fast-growing startups that stress the importance of talent, here’s a blueprint to help integrate and motivate your newest employees.

Before jumping into the day-by-day onboarding plan at Percolate, it’s worth covering the key tenets that guide it. These ideas are embedded in how and why the company rolls out its onboarding process the way it does.

Write it all down. For six months in 2013, half the people at Percolate had not heard Brier speak about its values and lay out the year’s kick-off plan. He fixed this by designing a thorough onboarding program that’d get new people acquainted with the company and its culture as quickly as possible. *Key here was writing everything down. Nothing scales better or faster than words*. The average adult reads two to three times as fast as she listens. Plus, documentation is a ready resource, while people aren’t always available.*

Distribute decision-making. For Brier, culture is how you make decisions, and the first exhibit of your culture is onboarding. “It shows your shared set of values and how they help people make decisions that are in the best interests of the company,” says Brier. “You can't scale a company without trusting people to make decisions without you. If you're going to do that, you need to provide a framework for making decisions, because not just any decision will do. You want them to make good ones.” The new hire is introduced to our values through the entire onboarding process. From the Day 1 Document to the office tour to department specific meetings the new hire learns just how our values inform decision making.

Make onboarding everyone’s responsibility. If culture is ultimately a framework for making good decisions, then there’s a big return on giving resources to onboarding, when employees start to learn how those decisions are made. “The goal is to give them as much exposure as possible to good decision making in their early days,” says Brier. “That’s where shadowing and creating time for observation becomes critical. And you want to involve as many existing employees in demonstrating these decisions as you can.”

Be thoughtful by design. This is one of Percolate’s values and means carefully crafting every interaction with respect for whomever is on the other end. “Our third hire was our VP of Design, so we’re a very design-centric company. It's continued to be an important piece of what we do. More than just the graphics and aesthetics, it's about being conscientious about the experience that customers and employees have,” says Brier. “The best way to convey our deep care for design is to involve everyone in creating that experience. Internally, onboarding is our first — and perhaps most impactful — way of achieving that goal.”

An Onboarding Plan: From Offer Letter to First Friday

At Percolate, the best way to internally articulate its culture, guided by good design and crafted by everyone, is a structured onboarding plan. Here, Brier lays out the process his company uses for new hires, from the moment they agree to join to the end of their first week. The company is constantly refining its process, but this has been its plan over the last few years.

Offer Letter Signed

Before the employee walks into the office, Percolate provides a lifeline and branded swag for the employee. This gives support to the new hire and demonstrates its brand and values. “Within 48 hours of receiving the signed offer letter, each hire receives a welcome email, establishing a point person to answer any questions and gather basic information via a ‘Welcome to Percolate’ survey. This assists us in preparing for the employee’s arrival,” says Brier. “In parallel, we send a welcome package — including a t-shirt, coffee mug, granola, tote bag and handwritten ‘congratulations’ letter.”

Most notably, each new hire receives a Kindle. “That's linked to a core idea that we are a learning organization. It's our responsibility to help encourage people to continue to read and make themselves better,” says Brier. “They can read whatever they want but personally I find the Kindle to be a pretty amazing device for continuing to find new ideas in the world.

Two Weeks Before Start Date

Each remote new hire — who’s based outside of New York — is provided with travel and accommodation details that have been arranged and purchased. Brier explains, “We bring everybody into New York. At our size and footprint, I'm not sure this will continue forever, but for now, we get everyone in to spend their first week in NYC.”

One thing that Percolate learned early on, especially opening new offices is that you have to export culture. “It's the only way it works. The first time that we tried to open an office outside New York we tried to do it without sending anyone from New York (our headquarters at the time),” says Brier. “That was a challenge. We learned that you have to export your culture by sending people who are already steeped in the way the company works out to new places. And not just regular people — but your best ambassadors — to make sure that culture continues to be built in the right kind of way.”

The Friday Before The New Hire Arrives

The Friday before the new hire starts, they get access to their email and a very full schedule for her first two days at work. “I know there are different schools of thought about onboarding schedules. Generally, we try to over-schedule instead of under-schedule for new employees,” says Brier. “In my own personal experience, it’s a weird feeling to show up on the first day and not having any work or idea of what to do. So we fill those days as much as possible.”

In summary, here’s the key information that’s delivered to new hires before their first week:

Practical instructions, including email login, arrival time and FAQs
Day One document (more below), a digital embodiment of Percolate’s culture
Email introduction to a “Percolator,” an employee who will reach out to welcome the new hire and act as another point person for questions and guidance
People Ops onboarding calendar, which outlines the first two days of meetings and Asana tasks for their first week
Default to filling new hires’ calendars. Don’t leave them with the feeling that you’re surprised that they showed up.
First Monday

New Digs. Percolate sets up the desks of new hires so that there’s no need to search for supplies. Standard issued items, such as a computer, monitor, notebook and pens, are laid out. “You walk in the door and you've got a desk full of everything that you need to get started,” says Brier. “One of the things that I've seen done poorly is when new hires need to wait until 2 o'clock to get their laptop. Obviously, that's the first thing everybody wants to set up and get going.”

An employee’s workspace is an opportunity to reinforce its strong design aesthetic and place in a broader community. In addition to items in Percolate’s orange hue, the company uses the products and services from fellow First Round Capital-backed startups, such as Poppin which provides stylish office products and furnishings.

Introductions. Every Monday morning, Percolate has meetings for both the business and product teams. These weekly kick-offs are an opportunity to do a quick introduction of new hires. It’s meant to be fast, not comprehensive, so that faces can start to become familiar.

Everybody gives a brief introduction, so the focus shifts around the room, but it’s not unwieldy or too lengthy. “You just say who you are, where you from and what college you attended,” says Brier. “One of our VPs is a huge college basketball fan and likes to guess the mascot, which most of the time he nails.”

Headshots. Not every company does professional headshots, but it’s an important detail to Percolate. “It’s something we do and people seem to really appreciate it. We have a photographer, who takes headshots for everybody,” says Brier. “It’s important to be a part of a community, and one key to achieving that is appearing to be part of the tribe. So, if you go view a few Percolate employees’ LinkedIn pages, you’ll find they share a very similar headshot.”

Day One Document. Six months after founding Percolate, Brier wrote the original version of Percolate’s detailed documentation of the culture of the company. It lives in Google Docs and has evolved in the hands of his employees. “The Day One Document is a prime example of our belief in *writing everything down.* I think we’ve done well by over-documenting everything. *We find that words scale well, which is essential as people spend less time with you individually, if you’re a founder. With a document like this, your team can asynchronously learn and engage.*”

So what’s in a Day One Document? “There's a lot going on, and it’s as defined by what it is as by what it isn’t. It is not your HR read-through of your benefits,” says Brier. “It’s our living, breathing document that covers all aspects of our culture, from where the company comes from to our point of view on meetings. Mostly it’s about our culture, ideas and methodology. We try to focus on explanations, not rules. In fact there are just three listed rules at Percolate.”


Table of Contents and first page of the Day One Document

"The Rules" from the Day One Document

"Meetings" section of the Day One Document
Introduce Yourself Email. As outlined in the Day One Document, a hire sends an “Introduce Yourself” email at the end of the first day. It’s a scripted greeting to the company from the new hire sharing a bit of background and trivia. “*Everyone who starts with the company sends one out. It also includes a photo and a link to three questions on Barista, Percolate’s internal Q&A platform. The idea is that it’s not about just giving information, but starting an exchange with your new team,*” says Brier.

As Percolate uses Google Groups, the “Introduce Yourself” emails live on as an archive of — and inspiration for — every introduction sent by a new hire. “People go back and read them, for guidance, perspective or pure entertainment,” says Brier. “Early on, we encouraged people to share embarrassing photos for fun, but when we hit about 150 people, we thought it wise to move away from that prompt. So, we told people to include any snapshot, but embarrassing photos kept coming. Apparently, everyone was inspired by the old way. You can't totally control these things, but it works pretty well as a nice way for people to get to know each other.”


Examples of Introduce Yourself Emails
By The End of The First Week

After the first day, Percolate slots in departmental deep dives so that new hires get broad and meaningful exposure to the motivations and responsibilities of each team. “Every department presents throughout that first week,” says Brier. “That is something that I think is pretty important regardless of your position in the company. Whether you're an engineer or a designer, you get exposed to all of the other parts of the organization.”

There may be a few familiar onboarding meetings in this list, but here’s a few more specifics on how Percolate approaches new hires’ meeting with each of its groups:

People Operations. As this is the first group to interact with the new hire, this team typically provides an overview of its role, the facilities and general office culture. In a separate meeting, the team walks through benefits packages and enrollment.
IT. IT answers initial setup questions for all hardware and software given to the employee. They outline and offer support for any future technical problems.
Sales. Percolate’s sales team shares how it’s structured to most effectively make deals.
Design. The design team explains how it implements Percolate's brand via its mission: to create the best suite of products for marketers through a start-to-finish design process that inspires a collaboration. Given Percolate’s strong design culture, the group deconstructs each part of its mission. “One of those is ‘start-to-finish.’ We ask our designers to do everything from research all the way up to visual design,” says Brier.
Marketing. As a startup building marketing software, this meeting covers not only how Percolate brands itself, but also how and why it serves marketers.
Product Management. In this session, PMs explain the structure of the product team and Percolate’s approach to developing software. “Even if the new hire doesn’t need to know the technology stack that we use, we want all employees to be exposed to our technology,” says Brier. “In this meeting, we introduce the concept of the manager's versus the maker's schedule to educate every new hire on how to work with engineers. We get granular: don’t interrupt engineers, especially if they have headphones on.”
The comprehensive tour of each department reinforces Percolate’s principle that onboarding is everyone’s responsibility. This visibility also demonstrates how decision-making is distributed throughout the organization, and how each department presides over its purview. “Ultimately, these departmental deep dives are not just to show what each team does, but to expose the core philosophy of each group, and how it fits into the company’s overall mission.”

In-Between Time

In addition to meetings aimed at educating new hires about each team, Percolate schedules sessions to integrate new team members by jumpstarting relationships. Regardless of how casual they may seem, the company schedules them so as not to leave them to chance.

Coffee Break. Between the meetings with each department, new hires are trained to use Percolate’s espresso machine. “If you name your company after a coffee product then it's a requirement that you have good coffee products around. People tend to not necessarily know how to use it,” says Brier.

Walkabout. In between each session, a new hire is walking from room to room throughout the office. So each hire is assigned a “Percolator,” the new employee’s buddy for the week. To foster cross-team collaboration, the Percolator must be from a different department than that of the new hire. “This person checks in on you, takes you to lunch and introduces you to everyone. When we were small, Percolators would know everyone’s name,” says Brier. “Now that we’ve hit a critical mass, we’ve transferred the role to our office manager, who miraculously — regardless of how many people we add — continues to know each person’s name.”

Percolator lunch. During the first week, Percolators take new hires to the office’s favorite neighborhood restaurants to enjoy lunch and casually learn more about Percolate’s culture.

Time with the CEO to Conclude Onboarding

As the last of the big onboarding meetings, Brier takes the newest members of Percolate through the history, philosophy and culture of the company. He shares how the organization thinks about product-market fit and how that connects to its vision to build the system of record for marketing. Brier explains why the company documents everything and the new hires’ role in adding to that story.

“This presentation is probably 40 or 50 slides, but really it takes two hours. The goal is not a drawn-out monologue, but to spend time with them,” says Brier. “One of the things that I’ve realized as a founder is that when your company is really small, the percentage of time everybody gets to spend with you is pretty high. If you’re five people, everybody conceivably gets 20% of your time. That’s a lot harder at 200 employees. But founder connectedness is always paramount — especially at the beginning.”

Admittedly, much of what Brier explains will have been touched on in some way between when the hire signs the offer letter to when she finishes her first week. But his goal is not to be original, but to be resonant. “When it comes to your message — and certainly mission, vision and values — repeat yourself until you think you sound like a broken record. Then start repeating yourself some more. That's a good way to think about what your job is in building a culture and running a company.”

As you grow the company it’s important to remember that your time with people doesn’t scale. Focus on founder connectedness.
When Brier delivered his message about onboarding at the CEO Summit, he had just finished a quarter in which Percolate hired over 75 people — nearly a person a day. The company grew its headcount by 30%. So before onboarding, a significant contingent was unfamiliar with the company, let alone anything achieved the quarter before. That’s exactly why Percolate has developed an onboarding program to help immediately instill its history, culture and values in its new workforce. From an intriguing "Introduce Yourself" email to a well-designed new desk to the "Day One" document, Brier has made sure his new hires’ first impressions are impactful ones.

“Yes, remember that culture is the internal manifestation of your brand and that nothing scales better than words. But if you only take one thing, don't forget about founder connectedness, because from your perspective, you'll always feel more connected to your team than they will. Just sort of assume they're less connected to you than you think they are,” say Brier. “And that goes especially for the employees you’ve not yet hired. When you're growing fast, plan for them just as much as much as you're planning for your current team. They may not know their onboarding has started, but you must.”

> It's a great story to be shared and it looks great on the outside. Who knows how productive it actually is, how much of the story is retained and how their culture evolved.

http://firstround.com/review/This-Startup-Built-Internal-Tools-to-Fuel-Major-Growth-Heres-Their-Approach/

#### GET BUY IN

Of course, none of the effort or investment is worth it if you can’t get the people at your company to use the products that have been built for them. *Ensuring that people buy into internal tools is more than half the battle. As Percolate grew from 5 to 15 to 50 people it became more and more challenging to roll out new internal tools and keep everyone engaged.*

To get everyone onboard, Brier and his executive team did a lot of repeating. “I think this is true no matter what company you work at or what you're doing — you should repeat your mission, your vision, and everything else that is important so that people really internalize it.”

During every new hire’s onboarding, they spend their first week at Percolate getting exposed to the different tools that the company uses to communicate and get things done. It’s become a core part of the new hire experience. Of course, there are products that get used company-wide, and those that are only used on the team level. For the latter, the immediate manager carries the onboarding responsibilities.

*For example, to get everyone familiar with Barista, Day 1 training directs new hires to use the tool to send around an email to everyone introducing themselves and asking three questions. This gives everyone great exposure to the tool while also helping them answer questions they may have, says Brier.*

“I think the more that you can get your staff comfortable with the mindset that products are the most important thing, the better product you will build externally.”

http://firstround.com/review/the-tools-early-stage-startups-actually-need-to-understand-their-customers/

Many companies mistakenly build tools for themselves — instead of focusing entirely on their customers — because they understand themselves better than their customers. It's an easy trap,” says Reinhardt. “You should only be building your own tool if you've tried lots of others on the market and find that none of them will solve your problem. Only build if you’re left without a choice. And still take care: *I’d estimate that 50% of the startups that I see build tools can’t maintain them.”*

If you’ve done your research and decide to build, go in with eyes wide open. “Building your own analytics tools in lieu of unleashing all your resources to build your product can be dangerous. It can easily kill a startup,” says Reinhardt. *“Say you have three engineers and one of them is working on building your analytics tool. Your ability to develop your product is now cut by 30% so you need 30% more runway. That analytics tool is lot more expensive to build than it seems. Being capable of building something doesn't mean that you should.”*

If it’s not vendor research, the most simple and impactful preparation is simply to write down the objective — even if it is in hypothesis form — before testing the tool. “Enter the tool selection process with an attitude of confidence that comes from experimentation. It may seem apparent, but I’m shocked by how many companies forget this step because the are rushing to make a decision,” says Reinhardt. “Here’s an example: ‘Our goal in using the analytics tool is for our product team to have a complete picture of the activation funnel.’ In this case, define what 60%, 80% or 100% of a complete picture of the customer might look like at various stages of success with the tool. Test it with your data, and, at the end of two weeks, declare whether it hit mark. This setup will help you find the winner or keep you moving.”

> I like how he set an objective goal similar to increase team collaboration by 10%

#### Calculate the full cost of the tool.

Sticker price is only the beginning. *Quantifying time saved and opportunity cost gives a more realistic approximation of the true cost of a tool.* “There was a point in Segment’s history where we we had only three months of runway left. It was a very scary time and we ran through all of the scenarios to survive if we weren’t able to fundraise,” says Reinhardt. “Compared to people, tools were a small fraction, but we couldn’t part with either, even in our desperate situation. *It was because tools allowed us to save time, and that was hugely valuable.”*

Reinhardt and Segment compare the cost of a tool to the dollar value of their time. “Tools not only save us money on hourly cost, but also accelerate our work,” says Reinhardt. “Say you are assessing your time at $50 per hour and buying MailChimp at $100 per month will save you building an e-mail distribution tool. That’s clearly worth it. So for us, it was getting disciplined about measuring the tradeoff between our time and budget.”

That’s even before calculating opportunity cost. “In retrospect, it can be enormous,” says Reinhardt. “If the company succeeds then you're going to end up valuing your time a lot more than the $30,000 dollars a year you might be paying yourself. It’s harder to quantify given how highly variable it is, but it can tip the scale if you are making a 50/50 decision.”

If you are truly paralyzed in purchasing a tool or service, take solace in the fact that most contracts for these tools are far less aggressive than, say, your mobile plan. “I structure the deal with vendors to pay monthly, but pretty much all these vendors will do that by default, especially for a startup that’s pre-product-market fit,” As companies get bigger they’ll ask for annual contracts, but at that point, it’s not a big deal,” says Reinhardt. “The bigger deal is getting locked in; that is real. Say you start sending your data to a tool and six months later you discover you were using the wrong tool. What you actually need is that data in another tool. It's getting very difficult to untangle yourself, because you've installed tracking code all over the place.”

Switching cost is a variable to factor into the total expense of a tool. “Again, through the course of an early-stage startup, a company will use several tools in each of eight or so different categories. For example, your data must graduate from different analytics tools as your startup grows,” says Reinhardt. “Don’t get entangled in a tool that you don't want to use anymore or that your company has outgrown. One way to do that is to make sure that you are separating data collection from the tools that receive the data.”

Your expectation for each of these tool categories is that they are instrumented with your data and deliver insights that change how you make decisions. “That could be making choices faster, in a more informed way, or more collaboratively with your team or customers. If you have a tool running the background, but you’re never looking at it, it’s not valuable.”

*Success comes from implementing a tool, using it and making decisions with the data it’s serving up to you.
It’s enough of a challenge to structure and disentangle data; there’s no reason to have the same complications with the tools you use to manage it. *

#### Employee Onboarding at Startups Is Broken – Here’s How to Fix It

You’re greeted at the pearly gates to heaven by St. Peter who asks where you’d like to spend eternity. “Well, heaven of course!” you say. Peter replies: “You have to check out hell just to see what you think before you commit.” Disappointed, you shrug but agree. And to your surprise, when the elevator doors open into hell, you see golden beaches, golf courses, gorgeous people mingling with colorful drinks. It’s not what you expected, but maybe heaven is even better, you think. So you take the elevator back up, but all you find there is a bunch of dull harp-playing on clouds. There doesn’t even seem to be anything great to eat.

You go back to Peter: “I didn’t think I'd ever say this, but I think I’d rather go to hell,” you say. “So it shall be,” he says, and you head back down to start your new afterlife. Only this time, when the doors open, you’re met with fire, brimstone and flowing lava. “What is this?” you yell. “Where’s the beach? What happened?” Your welcoming committee stares at you blankly: “Oh,” they say. “Yesterday we were recruiting you. Today you’re staffed.”

This is Carly Guthrie's one HR joke. And after working in the business for over 15 years across a variety of industries, she says it rings true all too often. Today, she helps companies build HR organizations as a consultant and says this bait-and-switch happens all the time to new employees, sometimes despite the company’s best intentions. And when it does, no one benefits. In this exclusive interview, she lays out a plan for onboarding that sets everyone up for success.

TURN HR INTO A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE

“There’s this dark alley knife fight for the best talent in the tech industry right now,” says Guthrie. “Everyone is so focused on getting the best people in the door, it eats up all this bandwidth and sucks the life out of them, but as soon as they win the battle and get someone to sign, they drop the ball.”

There’s this dangerous mentality of simply getting butts in seats with little thought paid to the onboarding process or the new hire’s early experience. Two things can set the tone of tenure:“Everyone wants to feel cherished, especially after being so vigorously pursued,” she says. “People who are this talented get calls from recruiters all the time, and if they suddenly realize that they’re just a number or a cog in the wheel to you now, they have other options.”

“You need to weaponize your HR process to not only get the best talent, but keep them.”
According to Guthrie, a fully-weaponized HR approach is a tool you use to your benefit, not something that's an afterthought. It's coherent, consistent, culturally aligned and owned by someone in particular —whether it’s a consultant, office manager, or head of HR.

FIRST, FIND SOMEONE YOU CAN TRUST

“To really optimize someone’s first experience with their work environment, you need to be thoughtful about how to improve the onboarding process and provide hospitality,” says Guthrie. “First days are an opportunity to tell the story of who you are and what you want to accomplish, and have that stick with every single person who joins your organization. You want to take the opportunity to validate their decision to join.”

This doesn’t mean you have to have an in-house HR person or department. It’s all about the process, which should be developed as early in your company’s life as possible, and having someone to execute it. “Even if you’re working with an HR person on contract or part-time, you want to start early,” she says. “It’s a lot easier to build trust and understanding with an HR person when you’re talking about defining culture and onboarding. The last thing you want to do is bring them in when you’re already in hot water."

> So far it's like she's trying to sell HR

For example, it’s very challenging for someone to help you navigate firing someone if they just met you and are coming into the organization cold. No company escapes the need to have tough conversations like this. If you run a company or manage people, you’ll inevitably need to address low performance or the possibility of letting someone go. “It’s incredibly hard to do those things solo without a sounding board, especially a sounding board you can trust to give their honest opinion,” says Guthrie. That’s a major reason you should seek out a constructive HR relationship early, while you’re still small.

> Now really, what's this got to do with on-boarding? You are actually an HR consultant trying to sell your business

“If you’re at a really early-stage startup, you definitely don’t need someone full-time, but someone at the company should wear this hat. I would recommend looking for someone with HR experience who can also do office manager work rather than the other way around.”

DON’T MISS THE DAY 1 OPPORTUNITY

“From a sheer tactical standpoint, you’re never going to have the same opportunity to impact people that you do on their first day,” says Guthrie. “Everyone’s feeling great and psyched to be there, they’re willing to sign their lives away. You have to be organized enough to make them feel even more awesome and reaffirm their choices.”

> they’re willing to sign their lives away. like what are you talking about lady? What type of a company have you been living in where people sign their lives away?

“Day one is your chance to be who you said you were in the recruiting process.”
You don’t want to be fake about this. When asked about their culture, a lot of companies will say something like, “Oh yeah, we like go bowling and hang out all the time like friends...” But that all starts to sound the same. By being a bit different, you have the chance to really set your startup apart.

> You don't want to be fake about this. I don't understand you lady, what type of companies have you been working with?

“Create an experience where someone walks in on their first day and everyone is already expecting them. Everyone already knows their name and what they're there to do. Everyone is super welcoming and understanding of the fact that being one new hire meeting so many new people is overwhelming,” says Guthrie. “Don’t make them wonder where and how they’ll eat lunch. Remove all of those small obstacles that cause first-day nerves. All of this shows a level of thoughtfulness that many organizations fail to accomplish.”

> Yes, eating lunch it's like the biggest priority after they signed their lives.

Before getting into tech, Guthrie managed HR for the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group, owner of elite California restaurant The French Laundry— and their success is no secret. “They are incredibly, incredibly thoughtful about every detail of a guest's dining experience,” she says. “Ahead of time, they'll have already considered food allergies and preferences, even menu items you might have tried previously. It’s a level of care and attention that often gets lost in modern times, but it goes a really long way toward making things special, memorable.”

> Ok, you haven't worked in tech and you're mixing apples with pears, ok makes more sense now.

You don’t have to have all of the answers about your culture, or even what a new hire can expect down the line, she says. But by showing up and being willing to think through and act on the small things, you distinguish yourself and build trust.

THE PERFECT FIRST DAY

> You got me at the perfect first day, I am thinking about your St Peter joke.

(Rules for managers.)

Rule #1: Never have someone start their first day at 9 a.m.— have them come at 11. “That gives you a chance to get in, have your coffee, get through your email, and doublecheck that everything is set up for them to arrive,” she says. “By the time it's 11 a.m., you can give them your full attention, help them get the paperwork out of the way, and introduce them to the team.”

Rule #2: Don’t outsource a welcome. “It’s always better for someone’s manager to be the one to show them around and make introductions,” says Guthrie. That said, everyone should know the new person is starting and should proactively walk up to greet them as well. These introductions should serve a purpose. Everyone should know to say, “Hi, my name is Joe. I work in product and am responsible for X.” (Not just “I’m Joe, I sit over there.”) You want to give your new hire pieces of a puzzle that will fit together quickly so that they understand the team and how they work together.

> You don't get to understanding the team or the inner-workings by listening to who is responsible for X answers

Rule #3: Keep the first day light. “Very few people get a good night’s sleep before starting a new job, so be respectful of that. You can have some meetings planned, but remember there’s a lot of information coming at that person and it’s hard. Even the most confident, ‘I’ll dive right in’ person is still learning a bunch of new names and faces. Set the expectation: 'This first week you should not be here past 5 p.m. Your job is to be a big sponge, and we want you to have time to reflect and recharge before coming back every day.'”

> How do you know about getting a good night's sleep? Be respectful to what? He or she didn't sleep well? It's outside of my control.

Even if you talked about long, grueling hours during the interview process and the candidate agreed to them — even if you said, “We literally never go home, we have no lives” — don’t make that the case the first week. “People pick up on so many written, verbal and unspoken cues when they start a new job. Be sensitive to the sensory overload.”

> be sensitive to sensory overload? what does that mean?

Rule #4: Clue them in on the vernacular. Every company has its own secret language, especially if people have been working together for a while. It’s made up of inside jokes and shorthand that can be intimidating and even alienating for someone new. “When I directed HR at Readyforce, we worked with so many hilarious people, we had all of these jokes with each other. So part of our onboarding was literally looping people in on insider stuff, saying things like, ‘Oh, when so-and-so says this, this is what she means...’” Figure out what those things are at your company, and make them inclusive in your onboarding. Don’t let them make a new hire feel like an outsider.

> Ok, it's not clear what's the purpose of this and whether this is a rule, confusing article

ONBOARDING BEST PRACTICES

“Number one, be who you said you were during the recruiting process,” Guthrie says. “Let people make a conscious and accurate decision for themselves. Don’t tell them the hours aren’t that bad if they are. Don’t tell them you all hang out all the time if you don’t.”

Beyond that, there are a number of logistical steps you can take to make someone even more enthusiastic, excited and dedicated coming in than they were already.

“Make sure their desk is set up and that they have all the tools they need — and go the extra mile. It’s one thing to have a computer waiting for you. It’s another to have Chrome and everything they will need already installed,” she says. “There should be a welcome note, ideally handwritten by their manager, and some nice SWAG. People are excited on their first day. They’ll want to start repping your brand.”

> Keep saying SWAG, why do you see the material part of the integral part of their life? You are not saying anything about culture yet.

Again, this is where a little extra goes a long way. “Really great companies don’t only provide SWAG for the new employee (even better, in the right size), but also for their partner and kids if they have them. If you’re a manager and you don’t know what the situation is, simply ask: ‘Do you have anyone else we can get things for?’ Maybe their dad is super excited about the job and would want a T-shirt. Making that happen is incredibly thoughtful, and T-shirts cost nothing in the grand scheme.”

> Yes, getting a T-shirt for my dad will make me think twice before quitting an abusive workplace. It's about SWAG ain't it?

“The good will that a great welcome experience generates is priceless.”
“Remember, when someone joins your organization, it’s not just them that’s working there. Especially if they work long hours that can impact their entire family.”

To create great beginnings, you have to play a couple moves ahead. You should know who is taking the person to lunch and what their entire schedule looks like for their first week. “You should have all of this written down for them, with any meetings already on their calendar,” says Guthrie. “Tell them, ‘I want you to just take everything in and meet as many people as possible, so I’ve set up these meetings, and here’s a little blurb about the people involved and why this is important.”

Finally, as a manager, be constantly available and interruptible in the first several weeks. “Tell your new hire to keep a list of questions that can be addressed during a regular, pre-scheduled meeting once a week, but that you’re also always available to answer anything urgent.” *She recommends starting a shared Google Doc where the new hire can write all of their questions. That way managers can see what’s on their mind.*

> The first good advice except it's in the context of letting people interrupt you. That's why you are doing async in order to let people not interrupt you.

“To make people feel really cared for, you can’t just be thinking about today or tomorrow. You should know what the first six weeks will look like before they even get there. What do you want them to accomplish in the first 90 days? You should already have this in mind so that if they aren’t a perfect fit, you know by that 90th day, not the 900th day.”

EXPENSIVE MISTAKES

“A lot of companies hide behind this excuse: ‘Well, we’re a scrappy startup and moving so fast that we don’t have a lot of time to do things like put Chrome on a new hire’s computer or set up someone's desk,’” Guthrie says. “It might be something that simple, but it sends the message that you can’t be bothered, that you’re not into the finer details, that you’re about broad-strokes, andmost dangerously, that they shouldn’t trouble you to ask questions. What does this tell people about how to treat your company's product or users when they see a bug or something wrong?”

> Not installing Chrome (at least this seems to be what the author thinks we do) doesn't have any impact of the outcome of the entire process. It's about people and you keep avoiding this and going back to the material and if there's no Chrome, well they SHOULDN'T trouble you with questions. How did you make that leap?

“Sloppy onboarding turns into sloppy culture.”
“If you accept the fact that people are too busy to give new employees a good experience, that attitude will perpetuate every time you bring someone new on.”

> Not really, it depends on the people you hire. Some people will understand it's a busy environment and see how they can integrate and that's it. There is something I am missing in this part.

You say you’re too busy. You work at a tiny startup after all. But that’s no excuse, Guthrie says. “You’re not too busy. You just spent all this time, energy and money getting this new person to join. Blowing it is going to cost you even more when you have to start the hiring process again from scratch. Don’t make someone feel like you’re too busy to make them feel good about choosing to work with your company.”

> Yes, but you understand the goal was to hire. Onboarding doesn't mean hiring. And the way you describe it it's clearly not useful at all. This article is full off all or nothing thinking.

Your goal should always be to make people believe on a gut level that your organization is so amazing that they couldn’t possibly work anywhere else. Building that attitude starts immediately once an offer letter is signed. And if you do it right, when the phone rings and it’s a recruiter on the end of the line offering the next big thing, they’ll say, “Sorry, I’m happy where I am.”

> But there are other places where you could work for you are not selling them some shades. You see reality this way because I tell you to.

#### Build Your User Base with These Human Behavior Hacks

CONFIRMATION BIAS — YOUR NO. 1 ENEMY

“If you believe something will work, you'll deliberately or even subconsciously ignore any feedback to the contrary, and you’ll focus only on the feedback that backs up what you already think,” says Alvarez. “Now consider how much nearly delusional conviction startup founders need to have about their companies just to raise money and survive, and you can see why they fall prey to this all the time.”

Confirmation bias manifests in a few ways:

Only talking to people we think will agree with us.

Writing off people who don’t agree with us as idiots or haters.

Asking questions designed to support our hypothesis.

Let’s say you ask someone how they’d choose to use a particular service, and they respond by basically repeating the checklist you have in your mind for why they’d choose to work with you. This is very exciting. So much so, that you probably won’t ask the contrary question: *“What’s one thing that would cause you not to purchase a service like this?” Asking that question is dangerous because they might say something you can’t fix or can’t afford to fix right now.*

“It requires a ton of humility from founders and product leaders to remember they’re subject to confirmation bias,” Alvarez says.

To a founder, their company is their baby. No one wants to hear that their baby is ugly.
“You really have to choose to hear it,” she says. “You have to very proactively and consciously shift out of this selling mode of absolute certainty that you’ve used in front of investors and recruits. You have to come back to neutral and go into conversations with customers as an objective observer. If something you assumed is contradicted, just record that the way a video camera would in that situation.”

While you can’t remove bias from your mind, continually reminding yourself it exists is remarkably effective. Maybe you like candidate A better than candidate B, but because you know about your bias, you can ask whether candidate A just happened to be more vocal or forceful. Likewise, if everyone says your product is phenomenal and they’ll definitely use it, you can look at your questions to see if they were designed to elicit praise.

Alvarez’s top tip? Take a note taker with you into every customer development conversation. That way you can focus on interviewing a customer without splitting your attention, and you’re much more likely to capture everything — including the contradictions. Take this one step further by making sure your note taker isn’t invested in the same things as you.

On her team at Microsoft, an engineer usually sits in on these calls and takes notes while a design researcher interviews. On other teams that she coaches, interviews are conducted by product managers. Usually the PM will have a strong belief in what customers want. The engineer probably doesn’t. Afterward, when you debrief, you're much more likely to surface the truth.

The PM might say, “I think they really liked our solution.” And the engineer, freed up to really hear the call from a different perspective, might reply, “I’m pretty sure they were just being polite.” That’s how you counteract bias. You start small and take it interaction by interaction.

Alvarez has experienced this firsthand as a neutral note taker. She once sat in on a call where the customer spoke freely until freezing up halfway through the conversation. When she pointed out this shift out to the PM, he said he didn’t notice the change in temperament. Together, they were able to determine what had triggered that reaction so they could fix how they asked some critical questions and get honest replies.

“Good product leaders will take their note taker’s word to look deeper even if it means admitting they're wrong,” she says. “You can spot a bad product leader the moment they get defensive rather than constructive.”

HINDSIGHT BIAS

This is another behavioral economics concept that roughly says: “Oh hey, we knew it would work all along.”

When you fail to write down all the times you were proven wrong and had to course correct, you’ll forget. Especially if your product ends up succeeding, you’ll think you just had good instincts. Your fundamental beliefs must have held true. Sounds great, but the next time you launch something or try to break into a new market, you might skip or skimp on your customer development — because, geez, aren’t you usually right without having to worry about that stuff?

“This happens to everyone, no matter how long they’ve been doing something,” says Alvarez.

I hear it at Microsoft all the time — someone will say, 'We've been the market leader for 30 years,' and I think to myself, 'Okay, well you're not anymore.'
The remedy of course is to diligently document things as you go, and to make these flash-points and about-faces visible and easily searchable. When you launch something similar in the future, you want to be able to go back and pull up all of the false assumptions you made and pivot points you hit. Learning from these moments is how you’ll go faster in the future.

*There’s a wall at Yammer headquarters where one of the engineering managers has written every experiment that his team has conducted in the last year. He uses green for winning A/B tests and red for failing A/B tests. You can clearly see where assumptions were debunked and theories rewritten, and it serves as a helpful and unmissable reminder to stay nimble, accept course changes with grace — and most importantly, remember them.*

“We’re smart people. We know our product. We know our customers. But we still screw up,” says Alvarez. “If you can look at past screw ups and see where you adjusted and shifted things or started believing something new, you can apply those lessons going forward, and you’ll always remain experimental because you’ll know you’re never infallible.”

SUPPORTIVE BIAS

This is you saying, “I already made this decision, so I'm going to defend it tooth and nail.”

Otherwise, you might experience some uncomfortable cognitive dissonance. The best example: You bought a car for a lot of money. There’s stuff about this car you hate, but damn it, you’re going to keep driving it because if you don’t, you’re the idiot who bought a crappy car.

This is a huge factor in customer development and interviewing. “If you ask someone about the tool they use to solve their problem today, even if they didn’t choose it, they’ll defend their current method,” says Alvarez. “It could be crystal clear from your outside perspective that their current process is terrible. But they won’t admit it. Sometimes they won’t even see it.”

Maybe you’ll ask a marketer how they send out email campaigns, and they’ll detail their 35-step process for you. Maybe it includes Post-it notes and running some sort of hacky script and takes half a day. You’re thinking they’re crazy, and that you have an awesome opportunity to sell them something different. But it won’t work like that. They already use this other thing. That’s the way their world works, and it’s beyond hard for them to accept an alternative. If you ask them to rate their solution on a scale from one to 10, they’ll say ‘eight.’ If you ask them what they’d improve about it, they’ll give you superficial, unhelpful answers.


*To win at customer development, you need to ask questions that get people away from supportive bias. For example, you could prompt that marketer with:*

*Suppose a new co-worker joined your team and you wanted to help them get up to speed with sending email campaigns. What advice would you give?
If you had to pick just one element of your email campaign process to improve, what would it be?
If your manager decided unilaterally to pick a new email marketing tool, what would you dread most about learning the new tool?
When people think about giving advice to that new co-worker, their desire to be helpful outweighs their supportive bias. When you ask about just one good or bad element, you’re allowing them to continue believing their current process is okay while honestly criticizing the worst parts. (And if the interviewee comes to the conclusion that, ‘Hey, our current process is terrible!’ on her own, well, even better.)*

HYPERBOLIC DISCOUNTING

We give more weight to things that are happening sooner than later. You’d like to lose 10 pounds, but there’s a slice of cheesecake right there. In an ideal world, we’d resist temptation, eat salad instead, and then we’d be happy. We think we can do this. But the reality is we suck at predicting the future, and we suck at making tradeoffs that require us to.

“This means, we often say we’re going to do something but we won’t,” says Alvarez. “In order to get a certain benefit, we set goals to run every day for a half hour, or to meditate for 10 minutes in the morning or to do laundry every week. It sounds easy but it isn’t at all.”

When you apply this thinking to products, you can see how people default to what works best for them right now. Hyperbolic discounting explains why many people continued to tape programs on their VCRs after TiVo came out.

“You could tell people, ‘If you just learn this new interface, then your favorite shows will automatically be saved on your TV,’ and they’d say with a straight face, ‘Oh that’s nice, but I just learned to program my VCR.’” People end up undervaluing future benefit and overvaluing short-term gratification.

So given this backdrop, how can you get customers to be honest about what it is they'll do? How can you more accurately see into their future behavior?

**Stop asking people about the future. Ask them only about the past.**
*Assume that people’s capacity for changing past behaviors is plus or minus 5%. Someone who's willing to walk up two flights of stairs will probably be willing to walk up two and a half flights of stairs, but they’re not likely to sign up for a marathon. Some people might, but you can’t build a business around that.*

“Even if this person tells you they're definitely going to run a marathon, you have to be suspicious,” she says. “The best way to figure out if they actually will is to ask them how many miles they ran last week. How many races did they run last year? If the answer is zero and they’re just getting started, their predicted future behavior is highly unlikely.”

She recommends asking questions like:

In the past week, how often did you do X?
Last time you did X, how long did it take?
Last time your team did X, how many people needed to get involved?
You want to capture quantitative data about what happened in the past. It won’t lie to you.

This is an area that’s especially sensitive to negative judgment from others. People want to idealize their future selves. They want to believe in their ability to work toward those goals. So when faced with past behavior that runs contrary, they might get defensive. They might be dishonest. You have to phrase your questions to make it acceptable for people to give answers that may not be perfect or socially acceptable.

*“Instead of asking someone if they let their kids use an iPad (an assumed negative behavior), ask them how many days in the past week their kids used an iPad,” says Alvarez. “Most people will answer honestly because you already implied that the answer won’t be zero — and that it’s not zero for the other people you’re talking to.”*

You want to allow people to tell you things — like the fact that it takes them a half day to send out an email campaign. Instead of asking how long something took, ask, “Did it take longer than six hours?” You don’t want the person to feel bad or like they might be doing a bad job when you point out the shortcomings of their existing solution. That’s when they'll shut down and you can’t learn any more from them.

If you make someone choose between being honest and being perceived as good, they'll always choose the latter. So don't put them in that situation.

HACK YOUR BEHAVIOR

Recognizing common customer biases and knowing the quick fixes described above is one thing. But the most successful startups will use this information to change behavior in their favor from the start. It’s hard to do when you’re running a million miles a minute with limited resources, but there are simple, systemic things you can do early.

One of the most impactful things you can do is capture data from customer interviews the right way. It all boils down to the power of storytelling and making it a tradition on your team.

When you’re interviewing customers, you tend to summarize what they said in a few bullet points. You can do that for brevity, but to make it stick, think of how you’d present this information as a story.

What details would you include to make it interesting or non-obvious or entertaining? Those are the helpful tidbits that slip by when you prioritize brevity. In a story, you’re more likely to include the questions you asked and if you changed them and why. You can better frame your findings in terms of, “We used to believe the world was this way, and now we have new information that tells us that it’s this way instead, so as a result we’re going to do this...”

"For example, we used to believe that it was really important for C-level executives to participate on Yammer," says Alvarez. "If the CEO posts, then that sends the message that this is a credible and valuable tool. And that’s not wrong, but we’ve talked to so many employees at large companies that are many levels away from the CEO. If the CEO loves Yammer but Jane’s boss thinks it’s a waste of time, Jane isn't going to use Yammer. So we need to make sure the product works at the small team level — and make sure all of the Jane’s-bosses of the world understand the value of it."

Putting your customer research into this framework makes it stickier and more memorable. Especially when your company grows out of the “everyone sits at one table” phase, it’s easy for a lot of the detail to get lost. As a result, your product team might seem like they’re changing their mind all the time. This isn’t a small thing. When people don’t understand the company's vision or how and why the product is being built a certain way, they leave.

Stories are sharable and lend clarity. They contextualize data in a way everyone can understand and rally behind. Generally, people are okay with pivots if they understand the impetus.

This is where it becomes very helpful to have a dedicated point person managing your customer development workflow. In a perfect world, you’re doing this so early on that it’s 'all hands on deck' and everyone is making calls to interview customers, but it's still handy to have a point person who's responsible for converting notes into stories, among other things.

These tasks should extend to what Alvarez calls “eavesdropping and interrupting.” At Yammer, she was the person in charge of shaping and growing the customer base, and she and her team would attend any meeting where customers were discussed. “We would sit in and listen for wrong assumptions so we could counter them one at a time. Even if we didn’t have the data, we’d say, ‘That sounds like an assumption. Let me go talk to people and figure out whether it’s true or not,’” she says.

Being good at customer development can make you annoying or even unlikable. But it also makes you absolutely vital to the org.
Any customer development expert needs to get used to being the source of bad news and taking the arrows without getting defensive. “They just need to be really practiced at saying, ‘I know, I know. We all wanted the same thing. We all wanted this to work out. But we talked to 10 people and they disagreed with our current direction.’” It will pay off.

SCALE YOUR ADVANTAGE

Understanding how behavioral economics influences your customers and your team is a significant competitive advantage. Given that it’s much easier to apply these tactics early when your company is small, it requires considerable effort to scale them as you grow.

“The best thing you can do is make these lessons part of onboarding,” Alvarez says.

*When Yammer entered hyper-growth and onboarding became more formal, she would give a 40-minute talk about how customers are not always right about what they want, how and why to ask non-leading questions, and how to capture feedback from customers in a way that can be funneled back into the product.*

“Our goal was to immediately give them the conversational patterns they’d need to surface real information every time they had a conversation with a customer,” she says. “Everyone we hired wanted to be helpful and to listen. But they didn’t know what they should be noting down or how to frame their questions in a way that would focus on past behavior or yield more honest answers.” As part of onboarding, they would simulate these types of conversations and rehearse until there was a certain amount of “muscle memory” to their delivery.

Following onboarding, you want to make it easy for people to send in the customer feedback they usually get piecemeal in a way that’s visible to as many people on the team as possible. Reports should not be private. People should be alerted to how much of this information is flowing in all the time, even if it’s just about little things.

“If you can start this stream of data flowing back from your field, then you’re constantly reinforcing this practice of never making assumptions and always keeping biases top of mind so you can bust them in real time," Alvarez says.

"At Yammer, field sales and product folks share questions they’ve heard, usage patterns they’ve seen, and pitches that have successfully convinced customers. People will share a 1-2 sentence observation on Yammer that they would’ve been reluctant to put in an email that clutters up hundreds of inboxes." Other services like Slack that promote more granular communication work too.

BUILDING AN INSIGHTFUL CULTURE

Early on, you have the opportunity to use behavioral economics to create a culture where everyone thinks deeply about what customers truly want, not what they just say they want. These are the cultures that are capable of true surprise and delight, because they build things people love but didn’t expect. There are a few things you can do to make this happen.

First, become skilled as a leader on your own. Alvarez regularly attends and gives workshops where customer development professionals and program managers from across many companies meet to swap stories, share challenges and brainstorm solutions. She’s part of a distribution list where people send their notes from customer interviews to help people structure their own. If you’re just getting started, consider seeking out your peers and forming these types of networks — your investors or accelerator or co-working space might help.

Keep up with trends and influencers working on these problems by curating a Twitter list and checking it once a day for interesting learnings. Alvarez has made this a habit, following many of the lean startup evangelists who are big on thoughtful customer development like Eric Ries, Laura Klein, Janice Fraser and Jeff Gothelf. A blogger named Justin Wilcox runs a valuable site called Customer Development Labs with recent thinking on bias and interview tactics, too.

Second, if your company is pre-product or extremely small, don’t shy away from pulling in friends and family to help. For instance, you could draft an engineer friend to accompany you on calls as a note taker to capture more objective data from your interviews. Take people up on these favors while you can. Don’t wait for more resources to start sussing out what your customers really think.

And finally, as you start onboarding more customer-facing folks — sales, customer success, etc. — you can reward those who are proactive and diligent about sending high-quality feedback to the product team. “I’ve been at a couple companies where product managers rewarded good customer service reps by volunteering to join them on customer calls, or sharing a preview of new product screenshots, etc.,” says Alvarez. “More access is an incredibly motivating reward when it’s earned. As the teams grew, the people who did a good job got more attention, which helped them do their jobs better, and on and on in a virtuous cycle.”

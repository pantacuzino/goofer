# Customer Interview Questions

Depending on the type of customer the answers might be relative to their knowledge. I want to be able to ask clear and concise questions.

1. Do you know what Quora or StackOverflow are or have you used another type of Q&A system? [Y/N]

2. If No, have you ever read a Reddit AMA?

3. Do you remember what is was about?

4. Did you contribute to the AMA by asking questions, upvoting answers?

5. If Yes, did you use any of the answers provided in accomplishing your goal? [Y/N]

6. If Yes, do you have a Quora or StackOverflow account? [Y/N]

7. If Yes, have you ever engaged by asking a question, choosing an answer, commenting or following a topic? [multiple choice]

You want to discover people who have already built this habit and start by working with them (lead by example) to promote this habit.

8. If [any of the above] then What is your Quora or StackOverflow handle?

You want to see how good are they at asking questions thus you check out their account to see how they engage within the community.

6. How often do you visit them? [daily, weekly, monthly, when I need to because I use google]



1. What types of questions do you want to ask?

You can ask "What are you working on right now?". The answer will change from week to week. Does the question has a definitive answer within a certain timeframe?

2. Do you often feel like your time is better spent without answering questions?

Try to gauge whether the person is trying to help others or not.

3. What's your go to method to respond to something you don't know?

4. Do you have a go-to person when you don't know the answer to something?

5. How does a new employee find out who should he ask?

6. Do you ever get close to other team members? How do you discover how they are like?

7. Have you ever created a document to be used as an explanation for other team members? Have you ever written documentation? How did you gauge the efectiveness of your writing?

6. How much of your daily time is spent answering questions? Are those questions timely or can you identify questions which get repeated?

7. How many pertain to a topic and should be placed there?

8. Do you find yourself often saying "I've written about that there"?

9. Do you find yourself forwarding information previously answered?

10. Does your team use any questions and answers platform such as quora or stackoverflow?

11. Do you have documents spread across various services?

12. Who acts as a knowledge bridge between departments? For example someone in sales needs to know how many X can they have for a customer. The number of X is known by the development team. How does this knowledge transfer happen?

13. Would you accept anonymous questions? Do you mind people asking you uncomfortable questions?

If that's your rate why don't you want to contribute weekly to your own Q&A?

Identify Q&A contributors within the organization.
